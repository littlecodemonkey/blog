It\u0026rsquo;s said to be the longest poem ever written and is packed with stories about duty, morality, and human relationships. It follows the tale of the Kuru dynasty, with a focus on the Pandavas and Kauravas and their eventual battle, the Kurukshetra war. Along the way, you’ll find tons of lessons about life and philosophy, including the Bhagavad Gita, which is like a guidebook for how to live your life.\nThoughts # Reading \u0026ldquo;The Mahabharata\u0026rdquo; feels like peeling back the layers of what it means to be human. It’s got everything: love, betrayal, courage, and redemption. The Bhagavad Gita, which is a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna, really makes you stop and think about what it means to do your duty, even when it’s hard. One thing I love about this epic is how it tackles the idea that doing the right thing isn’t always clear or easy. It reminded me a lot of the challenges we all face when trying to make the best decisions in tough situations.\nPersonal Takeaway # \u0026ldquo;The Mahabharata\u0026rdquo; makes you think hard about whether you’re really living up to your responsibilities. I found myself comparing the characters’ struggles to my own—like trying to balance personal goals with what’s expected of me. The story also highlights how our actions can have ripple effects far beyond what we imagine, which is a humbling reminder to think things through.\nThe Story # The Kuru Dynasty # The story starts with the Kuru dynasty and sets up the rivalry between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The Pandavas are five brothers who stand for righteousness, while the Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, are all about ambition and greed. This feud between family members is central to everything that happens later.\nThe Game of Dice # Things really kick off with a rigged game of dice. Duryodhana and Shakuni trick the Pandavas into betting away their kingdom, their wealth, and even their dignity. As a result, the Pandavas are exiled for 13 years. This sets the stage for the big conflict, as the Pandavas are determined to get back what’s theirs.\nThe Kurukshetra War # The Kurukshetra war is the main event. It lasts 18 days and is filled with intense battles, moral dilemmas, and epic speeches. Arjuna’s doubts on the battlefield lead to the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna breaks down the nature of duty and selfless action. The war is brutal, and both sides suffer heavy losses. It’s a reminder that even when you “win,” there’s often a cost.\nLessons and Legacy # After the war, the Pandavas reflect on what their victory actually means. They’ve reclaimed their kingdom, but they’ve lost so much along the way. Eventually, they decide to leave it all behind and head to the Himalayas in search of peace and liberation. This ending drives home the idea that life is fleeting, and what really matters is living with honor and doing your best to follow your path.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/blog/docs/reading/brodsky_challenge/003_gilgamesh/","title":"003 Gilgamesh","section":"Brodsky Challenge","content":" Gilgamesh # By Sin-Leqi-Unninni\nOverview # Summary # This is one of the oldest stories ever known. This is a Sumerian poem about Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk and ruled around 2700 BCE. This story was spoken and told orally, but clay tablets have been found. The tablets date back to around 2100 BCE. They are written in a cuneiform script called Akkadian. This was the Semitic language used in the Assyrian and Babylonian Around 1200 BCE, and the tablets were then compiled into their most complete form and into one single story by a Babylonian priest named Sin-Leqi-Unninni around 1200 BCE. These were multiple tales that were compiled into a larger story. Fragments were found all over Mesopotamia, so this story was widespread. The most complete version is called the \u0026ldquo;Standard Babylonian Version,\u0026rdquo; and it was discovered in Ashurbanipal\u0026rsquo;s library (an Assyrian king). This was discovered around the mid-19th century.\nThere are twelve tablets. This is very significant as its stories parallel later works. A major one is the Bible\u0026rsquo;s story of the flood in Genesis. The story also mirrors the Greek myth where Deucalion and his wife survive a great flood sent by Zeus and repopulate the Earth, although the story of Noah is much closer to Gilgamesh. A flood story predates Gilgamesh, and that\u0026rsquo;s the Mesopotamian Epic myth of Atrahasis. A god tells Atrahasis to build a boat to survive a flood meant to wipe out humanity.\nPersonal Takeaway # I read a few versions of this epic, and one of my favorite was the graphic novel version. The depiction of the Humbaba battle is fantastic. The new English translation by Stephen Mitchell was also quite good. It is much more readable than some of the older versions. Reading these first helped me understand the story and made the others more readable after knowing what was going on. Some of the versions are more raw and include more of the sexuality, humor, and tough concepts like Gilgamesh\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;first right\u0026rdquo; to women on their wedding day.\nSome of the versions tend to make this more academic, and some of the sexuality and humor is dropped. This was an incredible story that passed down through generations.\nUtnapishtim is brought in as if the reader/listener already knows who he is. It\u0026rsquo;s as if he\u0026rsquo;s the main charater in the previous epic that\u0026rsquo;s brought in for a cameo appearance. After researching more about this, he mentions that while he was a king his name was \u0026ldquo;Atra-Hasis\u0026rdquo;, which basically translates to \u0026ldquo;Exceedingly/Extraordinarily Wise\u0026rdquo;. This was the main character in the previous epic Atrahasis. In this Atra-Hasis is chosen by the god Enki (Ea) as well, to build an ark as well, to survive the flood. It\u0026rsquo;s very clear the reader is supposed to know him as the main character from this other epic. Atrahasis is a much older epic and Utnapishtim is a very old man in the Epic of Gilgamesh.\nThe epic of Atrahasis that I found (a translation by Stephanie Dalley) was only about 30 pages and quite an easy read. It was not part of the Brodsky challenge, but well worth the read to figure out similarities here.\nBook Summary # Tablet I: Introduction and Gilgamesh\u0026rsquo;s Rule # Gilgamesh is described as a demi-god. He\u0026rsquo;s two-thirds god and one-third human. He is strong and massive in size. However, he\u0026rsquo;s very oppressive. One of the rights of the king is called \u0026ldquo;first rights\u0026rdquo;. First rights are royal privileges, and the right a king has to be the first of anything. The first to resources, the first to food, and the first to fruits of labor. Gilgamesh abused this by claiming the virginity of women on their wedding night. The people of Uruk feel he abused his first rights, but this one is the one they resented the most.\nIn response to the people\u0026rsquo;s complaints, the gods created a wild man to confront him. This wild man is named Enkidu. Enkidu ends up being tricked into joining the human world by having sex with a human. The local farmer/hunter hired a prostitute to have sex with Enkidu so that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a wild animal anymore.\nTablet II: Enkidu\u0026rsquo;s Civilizing and Meeting with Gilgamesh # Enkidu is a huge man. The temple prostitute (Shamat) seduces Enkidu and brings Enkidu to challenge Gilgamesh. Enkidu stands at the doorway to a chapel to prevent Gilgamesh from claiming first rights to a bride, and they get into a fistfight. Gilgamesh barely wins. However, he grows as a person from the fight and the two become best friends out of mutual respect.\nTablet III: The Quest for Cedarwood # Gilgamesh, seeking fame, proposes a dangerous expedition to the Cedar Forest to confront its guardian, Humbaba. Enkidu and the elders of Uruk initially warn against it, but Gilgamesh insists. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting that Enkidu already knew of the dangers of the forest, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure where he would have learned of this, but he suddenly had knowledge of it. This was probably to make the story more suspenseful and make it sound more dangerous. Not a lot really happens in this tablet.\nTablet IV: Journey to the Cedar Forest # Gilgamesh and Enkidu travel to the Cedar Forest. Along the way, Gilgamesh experiences troubling dreams that Enkidu interprets as favorable omens. There are a lot of dreams in the Epic of Gilgamesh. This is no different. This is a main reason why I think tablet XII (12) fits in as a dream sequence.\nTablet V: The Battle with Humbaba # The two men confront and defeat Humbaba with divine assistance. They earn a tony of glory from this. Humbaba asks for mercy, but Gilgamesh does not spare him. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting that Humbaba pleads for his life, and Gilgamesh feels like the bad guy at a point. The monster (ogre) is clearly intelligent and speaks language. It feels a little like murder at the end. Perhaps this just didn\u0026rsquo;t age well.\nTablet VI: The Bull of Heaven and Ishtar\u0026rsquo;s Rejection # This is hilarious. The goddess Ishtar really goes after Gilgamesh. She\u0026rsquo;s tries really hard to romantically get involved with him. Gilgamesh then rejects her harshly. He brings up her past lovers and mocks her. She gets very angry and sends the Bull of Heaven to punish him. Gilgamesh and Enkidu slay the bull. This book is meant to be quite funny and there is a lot of entertainment here. I can imagine this story being told around Summarian campfires.\nTablet VII: The Death of Enkidu # The gods decide Enkidu must die as punishment for killing Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven. Enkidu falls ill and curses the events that led him to civilization but ultimately accepts his fate and dies. There is some foreshaddowing here as Enkidu goes a little crazy he starts talking nonsense, but there is some foreshadowing to Utnapishtim here.\nI had always understood that wedding rings were first associated with the Romans or with the \u0026ldquo;rings of love\u0026rdquo; from the Egyptians, who are sometimes credited with exchanging rings as symbols of love. However, while reading the Epic of Gilgamesh, I came across a passage in Tablet VIII that states, \u0026ldquo;of the wife place a ring on you, mourn you.\u0026rdquo; This could be referring to wedding rings, or I could be misunderstanding this.\nTablet VIII: Mourning Enkidu # Gilgamesh mourns deeply for his friend. He ends up building a monument for him as well. This shows the friendship between the two being one of intense emotion. Ancient Mesopotamian literature often blurred lines between intense friendship and romantic love. The texts talk about an intense emotional and physical relationship between the two. It reminds me of the relationship between David and Jonathon in the Old Testament. There are more undertones of a possible physical closeness between Gilgamesh and Enkidu than between David and Jonathon. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that either or both couples were gay, or maybe neither was. Intense friendships between men were a common thing in the past.\nDavid declares that Jonathan’s love was \u0026ldquo;wonderful, surpassing the love of women\u0026rdquo; (2 Samuel 1:26). I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure culturally what he means by that as I\u0026rsquo;m not as familiar with ancient Near Eastern culture, but in a more modern lens it does read as a highly emotional bond. I\u0026rsquo;ll unpack this more as I re-read the Old Testament.\nTablet IX: The Quest for Immortality # Gilgamesh now fears death after the death of Enkidu. He set\u0026rsquo;s out on a quest for immortality. He looks to find the only one he know of that has lived forever. This is the Mesopotanian version of Noah called Utnapistim. He was granted imortality by the gods. There are these half men half scorpians that he meets, that end up being helpful rather than evil. Gilgamesh then spends 10 hours traveling through pitch darkness to arrive in another place.\nTablet X: Meeting with Siduri and the Boatman # Gilgamesh encounters Siduri, a tavern keeper, who advises him to accept mortality. She is quite kind and Gilgamesh might be better off to just live his days out with her. He moves on howevers, and meets Urshanabi, the ferryman, who helps him cross the waters of death to reach Utnapishtim.\nTablet XI: Utnapishtim\u0026rsquo;s Story and the Secret of Immortality # Utnapishtim recounts the story of a great flood and how he and his wife were granted immortality by the gods. Utnapishtim then challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for seven days as a test, which he fails. Gilgamesh sleeps for all seven days, and Utnapishtim sets out bread that molds in various ways to prove he\u0026rsquo;d been asleep the whole time. Gilgamesh leaves, but as a gift for coming so far Utnapishtim tells him about a plant at the bottom of the water that can restore youth. Gilgamesh finds it, but then a snake steals it. (This feels very biblical too.) Gilgamesh immediatly gives up and returns to Uruk. The story is attempting to show he is accepting his mortality and taking pride in his legacy, but it just feels as he\u0026rsquo;s giving up.\nTablet XII (Appendix, not always included): Enkidu\u0026rsquo;s Spirit # A later addition, possibly unrelated to the main story, describing a conversation between Gilgamesh and Enkidu\u0026rsquo;s spirit. In this Gilgamesh asks a lot of questions about how the dead are doing and Enkidu describes them. I like to read this as if Gilgamesh is in a dream sequence as it makes more sense this way. Also there are a lot of dreams in this story so it makes sense.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/blog/docs/reading/brodsky_challenge/999_other_texts/001_old_man_and_the_sea/","title":"001 Old Man and the Sea","section":"999 Other Texts","content":" The Old Man and the Sea # By Ernest Hemingway\nOverview # Summary # \u0026ldquo;The Old Man and the Sea\u0026rdquo; is one of Ernest Hemingway\u0026rsquo;s most famous works. It was published in 1952, and this year for Christmas my buddy Wayne gifted my a first edition of the Novel. It\u0026rsquo;s a fairly short books, and less than 200 pages. It tells the story of an old man in a Cuban fishing village. This is a story of struggle, and it starts with the fisherman going 84 days without catching a fish.\nThoughts # Reading \u0026ldquo;The Old Man and the Sea\u0026rdquo; provides a deep reflection on the human spirit and its enduring quest for meaning. Santiago’s struggle with the marlin reminded me of the personal battles we all face, whether in careers, relationships, or life itself. There’s something profoundly human in the way Santiago perseveres, even in the face of overwhelming odds. It is also interesting to consider how Hemingway uses minimalism to create such depth, often leaving much unsaid. The idea that every victory can be hollow yet still worth pursuing resonates strongly.\nPersonal Takeaway # In a way, this feels like a story of meritocracy. Where the old man is successful because of his effort and perseverance. Despite his age and bad luck, his determination leads to his success in catching a big fish. It also is a story on how that meritocracy can be influced by external sources, especially related to the sharks. Merit and success are sometimes met with challenges beyond one\u0026rsquo;s control, but as long as you remain diligent you will be successful in honor.\nThe Story # The Old Man and the Boy # The old man befrinds a little boy, and the boy helps him fish for years. The boy, Manolin, is now forced to fish with another person because his parents believe the old man is unlucky in catching fish. The boy really cares for the old man, and there is a genuine feeling of love between them.\nThere is a lot of talk about American baseball, and the old man is a fan of DiMaggio. The old man teaches the boy dignity and pride in this.\nThe Struggle Begins # On the 85th day without a fish, the old man goes out in his skiff. He catches an enormous marlin. The fish pulls on the boat for hours, and the old man cannot reel it in. The old man doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a pole. He brings it in with a handline. The old man\u0026rsquo;s hands get torn up and bleed. At points he believes he is going to lose fingers. The conflict is very real, and the unwavering resolve of the fisherman to handle the pain is admirable.\nThe old man talks of memories, and as he fights, he wishes the boy was there to help over and over again. His mental resolve is incredible.\nVictory and Loss # After three days and nights of struggle, the old man finally catches the marlin. He ties it alongside his skiff and heads back in the way of Cuba. He has to guess which way the island is because he was drug so far off course. Sharks attack the marlin, and he loses a lot of it. Then, right before he pulls into the port, sharks come back and attack it again. There\u0026rsquo;s basically nothing left but a skeleton. It\u0026rsquo;s quite sad.\nReturn and Reflection # After the fight, the old man returns home and goes to sleep. He leaves the carcass tied to his boat. The boy visits him because he was worried the old man left three days ago. The whole village is talking about the enormous fish. Even though the old man is beaten up, he still has his pride as he felt he fought honorably.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/blog/docs/reading/brodsky_challenge/001_bhagavad_gita/","title":"001 Bhagavad Gita","section":"Brodsky Challenge","content":" Bhagavad Gita # By Vyasa\nOverview # Summary # The Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual book from around 200 BC. It was written by a man named Vyasa. As I looked deeper into this work, I found that I needed the context of where this book came from.\nThis book appears to be a 700 verse excerpt from a larger work called the Mahabharata. This is truly an epic poem and is thousands of pages long. It reads very much like a relegious text to me.\nBasically, in the larger poem leading up to these events, it appears there was a king named Vichitravirya. He had multiple wives. He had some children, but one took a vow not to be the king. The writer of the epic, Vyasa, impregneates the queen after the king\u0026rsquo;s death in order to create an heir. This is apparently a traditional practice called Niyoga.\nThe oldest son was born blind, and there were two more sons. When the king died of a sickness, they didn\u0026rsquo;t want the blind son to be king, so Vidura (a wise sage) picked the younger son Pandu to be king. Pandu ends up retiring into the forest and the Blind son (Dhritarashtra) becomes king.\nAt one point the Pandavas are apparently killed, so the blind king picks a different successor. It turns out they weren\u0026rsquo;t really killed at all, and they come back asking for the kingdom. They end up playing a dice game for the kingdom and losing, and then are exiled for 13 years. When they come back from exile 13 years later, they fight a war to regain the kingdom.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very chaotic and there is a lot going on. Historically, it mostly seems plausable except for a lot of the talk of Gods and super powers in strength and such. It\u0026rsquo;s so politically chaotic and they all seem to have at least some claim to the throne that even Krishna himself (God in mortal form) can\u0026rsquo;t choose a side. Krishna offers his armies to one side and himself as a guide to the other side to be as fair as possible.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where the Gita picks up, at the battlefield of this great war. Krishna is hauling the chariot of a great archer and warrior, Arjuna.\nThoughts # The Bhagavad Gita basically depicts a dialogue between Arjuna (this warrior) and Krishna (God in mortal form), while between two giant armies, immediately prior to the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and Kauravas.\nThe book seems best broken to me into three sections, chapters 1-6 (about the knowledge of self), chapters 7-12 (devotion to Krishna), and chapters 13-18 (relationship between atman and god, and the 3 qualities of creation).\nPart 1 (Chapters 1-6) # This one is the easiest for me to break up. This one is pretty obvious and talks quite a bit on the self.\nBook Summary # Chapter 1 # Summary # Krishna is hauling the chariot of Arjuna, and Arjuna feels like a badass and wants to be taken to the front lines to see the other side. There he sees relatives on both sides of the battle and it hits him hard. He knows that a lot of people are going to die, and he loses the will to fight. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to kill the people he loves and feels that life is worthless if he can\u0026rsquo;t spend it with his family. He thinks he\u0026rsquo;s better off being killed without a fight and lays down his bow and slumps into his chariot.\nThoughts # After reading three different versions, the only part that caught me as difficult to comprehend was the family tradition talk. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I read a new translation by Flood and Martin that it made sense. They are talking about the caste system in India. Everyone in power is part of the highest caste and there is talk that the world will go into ruin if the blood is polluted. As a westerner, it caught me a little offguard. I figure that I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have more of these cultural concerns as I go down this journey, but I have to admit that it was surprising. Reading these books in the context of the history and cultures they were written in will force me to drop some biases and ethnocentrism.\nPersonal Takeaway # One thing that really resonated and was timely about this was the fact that Krishna waited until Arjuna was in a horrible place in his life, and right in the middle of the battle to show him wisdom and tell him about God. If he was all powerful, why did he wait until this moment? There had to have been a better time. It made me think, and perhaps even realize, that maybe the timing was right. Sometimes you need to be in the right state of mind to accept knowledge. Perhaps, I myself wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gotten this out of the text had I read it earlier in life, when I was younger and had less experiences, so maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a point to me going through this literary journey at this exact point in my life.\nChapter 2 # Summary # This is about the practice of \u0026ldquo;yoga\u0026rdquo;. This continues the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna. Arjuna is still hesitant to go to war. Krishna first tells him that he needs to be more of a man or he won\u0026rsquo;t go to heaven. Arjuna, decides to not fight and Krishna changes tactics to take a more intellectual approach and explain more to Arjuna in detail.\nThe Soul - This talks a little about reincarnation at the beginning. About how our soul finds new bodies after death, and that while the body is affected by \u0026ldquo;weapons, fire, water, and air\u0026rdquo; the soul is not. It is never born and doesn\u0026rsquo;t die. It is forever and unchanging. There is some contradiction later where Krishna says even if the soul is born and dies you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t morn it because all things eventually end.\nThe Dharma - Dharma appears to be a relegious or moral duty from the text. It\u0026rsquo;s listed as the responsibilities of a warrior (Kshritya). Krishna basically tells Arjuna to \u0026ldquo;man up\u0026rdquo; and be stronger. A lot of this is about honor and that disgrace is a fear worse than death. There is a logic that, if he fights for this Dharma and dies he will go to heaven, and if he wins and lives then he will also win and gain great wealth.\nThe Kharma - Krishna tells Arjuna to not think about fighting and just fight. If he acts without thinking of the reprecussions he can act without fear and his brain won\u0026rsquo;t go haywire. Krishna then goes on to say that he should not worry about what he will gain from the action, that when action is performed for simply the action\u0026rsquo;s sake without the thought of success or failure, it is called Yoga. He mentions that Yoga is liberating to the mind and body. Once you learn how to act without thinking then he won\u0026rsquo;t need to learn anything from scriptures.\nThe Senses - When the mind is untroubled, unattached from all things, and the person just acts, then that\u0026rsquo;s a person of firm wisdom. He should avoid all senses and not dwell on senses because then he will desire things, desiring things leads to attachment of things, and attachment of things leads to anger, anger can lead to confusion and then weakness.\nThe goal here seems to be serenity. He basically is trying to get Arjuna to calm down and gain control over his senses and emotions so that he can clear his mind.\nThoughts # This seems very similar to some of the stuff the stocis say, and I\u0026rsquo;m really interested to follow up with the works of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurillus later and compare notes to this. I can also see a lot of where modern yoga came out of this book. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot in modern yoga about clearing the mind and avoiding attachments. The stuff on centering yourself and clearing your thoughts is facinating. You can really see how Krishna would be trying to convince him that everything was ok, and he could go ahead and fight.\nPersonal Takeaway # Chapter 2 seems to be the most powerful in the whole book. There are some real interesting topics about the individual and how a person should act and think. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible how more of these are applicable thousands of years later.\nChapter 3 # Summary # Chapter three is the Yoga of Action. Arjun ask at the beginning to Krishna, if you consider knowledge superior to action then why do you ask me to wage this terrible war? At this point Arjun is still trying to get out of fighting the war.\nKrishna explains there are two paths to Yoga. Te path of knowledge, for those inclined toward contemplation, and the path of work for those inclined toward action. He mentions that one cannot obtain freedom from karmic reactions from merely not acting, nor can one attain perfect knowledge by mere physical renunciation. Basically what he is saying here is that action is something you can\u0026rsquo;t avoid. Even maintain the body requires action of some sort.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a concept here called Nishkama Karma introduced as well. Basically this is performing actions without an attachment to the results. It promotes selfless action. There is a mention that if you\u0026rsquo;re a good person just to get into heaven, then you probably won\u0026rsquo;t get into heaven. You have to be a good person without any expectations. You are entitled to your work, but don\u0026rsquo;t feel entitled to the fruits of your labor. You should see the work you do as a service to society. Chapter 3, Verse 19 sums this up\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Therefore, without attachment, do your duty, because by working without attachment, one attains the Supreme.\u0026rdquo;\nThe main obstacles to spiritual progress are listed as desire (Kama) and anger (Krodha). Krishna advises to master these through self-discipline and self awareness.\nThoughts # There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to unpack here. The main thing is that you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do things for the outcome of those things. You should be doing things because you feel this is the best way to live.\nThis reminds me of the book \u0026ldquo;No More Mr. Nice Guy\u0026rdquo; by Dr. Robert Glover. I read this book right after my divorce and it was very inciteful. He states that \u0026ldquo;nicy guys\u0026rdquo; often act out of covert contracts. An idea of \u0026ldquo;if I do this, someone else with do this\u0026rdquo;. They expect approval, validation, or some form of reciprocation in return. There\u0026rsquo;s a thought here to take responsibility for ones one actions and live authentically, rather than seeking external validation. This very much aligns with the advice in the Gita to act without an attachment to the results. Instead the person should be focusing on doing what\u0026rsquo;s right.\n#### Personal Takeaway Krishna also talks about performing one's individual duty (Swa-Dharma) rather than trying to mimic others. No More Mr. Nice Guy mentions that \"nice guys\" often neglect their own needs to fit into other's expectations of them, or societal molds. The book talks about finding and following your own true purpose instead of seeking approval or avoiding conflict. I'm not certain if Dr. Glover read the Gita, but there are many parallels between his book and this chapter of the Gita. Chapter 4 # Summary # Krishna shifts from talking about action to knowledge, revealing that the wisdom he’s sharing is ancient but was lost over time. Then he drops the big reveal; he’s God in human form, here to restore Dharma. He tells Arjuna that whenever righteousness declines, he manifests to set things right, protect the good, and destroy evil. This introduces Jnana Karma Sanyasa, the idea that true renunciation isn’t about avoiding action but acting with knowledge and detachment. He expands on sacrifice (yajna) beyond traditional rituals, explaining that real sacrifice includes giving up ego, desires, and even attachment to knowledge itself. The key takeaway: if Arjuna surrenders to divine wisdom, he’ll be free from past karma and can move forward without fear.\nThoughts # Krishna takes things up a notch here, shifting from philosophy to straight-up divine authority. He’s not just giving advice anymore. He’s saying, I’m God, trust me. The idea that God shows up to restore balance when things go off the rails has a mythological feel, reminding me of similar themes in other religions. The part about sacrificing knowledge is unexpected—Krishna has been preaching wisdom, and now he’s saying not to cling to it too tightly. That tracks with the Zen “beginner’s mind” idea—true wisdom comes from letting go of rigid thinking. Also, the surrender to divine will here feels like an early version of Bhakti (devotion), similar to Christian ideas of grace—trusting in something higher wipes away past mistakes.\n#### Personal Takeaway This chapter refines the previous message: act with knowledge, but don’t get attached to outcomes. The deeper idea on sacrifice also hit me. People give up time, money, and energy all the time, but Krishna is talking about giving up ego and the need for control. That’s real freedom. Also, his message about past mistakes is powerful. You’re not bound by who you used to be, you can start fresh. This makes me want to explore more on Bhakti philosophy and also compare it to Stoicism, especially Epictetus, who emphasizes controlling what’s in your power and surrendering the rest. Chapter 5 # Summary # Arjuna is still unsure whether renouncing action or acting without attachment is the better path. Krishna tells him that both lead to the same goal, but acting without attachment is superior because it is more practical. True renunciation isn’t about avoiding responsibilities but about performing one’s duty without selfish motives. A person who works while surrendering the results is truly free. Krishna explains that a wise person sees no real difference between success and failure, pleasure and pain, or even friend and enemy. Those who master this mindset attain inner peace and unity with the divine.\nThoughts # This chapter makes it clear that renunciation is not about inaction but about mindset. Krishna shows that enlightenment isn’t found by withdrawing from the world but by fully engaging in it without attachment. That reminds me of Stoicism, especially Marcus Aurelius, who emphasizes doing one’s duty without concern for rewards or recognition. The idea that a wise person treats all experiences equally is tough to grasp but makes sense if the goal is inner peace. If you are not constantly chasing pleasure or avoiding discomfort, you remain steady no matter what happens.\n#### Personal Takeaway The biggest lesson here is that peace comes from letting go of control, not from avoiding responsibility. This applies to everything whether work, relationships, or personal goals. Focusing on effort rather than results keeps you from getting caught up in disappointment and frustration. This connects to modern ideas about mindfulness and flow, where success comes from being fully present in the process. Krishna keeps repeating this message, and I see why. It is simple but one of the hardest things to actually live by. Chapter 6 # Summary # Krishna shifts focus to meditation as the key to self-mastery. He explains that the true yogi is not someone who simply renounces the world but someone who balances action and detachment. A real yogi neither avoids responsibility nor becomes obsessed with results. Instead, they stay steady in all situations, free from attachment and ego. He describes meditation as the ultimate path to self-realization, where the mind is disciplined and focused only on the divine. The best meditator is one who sees all beings as equal and recognizes the presence of the divine in everyone. Krishna ends by declaring that of all yogis, those who surrender to him with devotion are the highest.\nThoughts # This chapter brings everything together. Krishna has been telling Arjuna to act without attachment, but now he’s explaining how to do it—through meditation. The way he describes it makes it clear that meditation isn’t just about sitting in silence but about training the mind to stay calm and focused. This connects to a lot of modern mindfulness and Stoic ideas. Marcus Aurelius talks about keeping the mind steady no matter what happens, which is exactly what Krishna is saying. The idea that the best yogi sees everyone as equal also stands out. It reinforces that detachment doesn’t mean indifference. It means seeing things clearly and acting with compassion instead of impulse.\n#### Personal Takeaway Krishna’s message about balance really resonates. It’s not about extreme renunciation or blind ambition but about being steady no matter what life throws at you. Meditation isn’t just about closing your eyes and breathing; it’s about building the mental strength to stay centered in the middle of chaos. That applies to everything. work, relationships, even personal struggles. Krishna keeps pushing the idea that the highest path isn’t just knowledge or action but a combination of both, grounded in discipline and focus. It’s easy to see why meditation has become such a central part of so many spiritual traditions. Part 2 (Chapter 7-12) # Chapter 7-12 # Summary # Krishna moves from self-discipline and meditation to bhakti, or devotion. He explains that everything in existence, both material and spiritual, comes from him. Some people seek him for selfish reasons, while others seek him with wisdom and love. He introduces the three gunas—sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance)—which shape human behavior. Those who transcend these qualities through devotion achieve liberation.\nKrishna describes himself as the ultimate reality behind all things. He is time, creation, destruction, and the source of all wisdom. In Chapter 10, he lists the ways he manifests in the world, from the Himalayas to the power of speech. In Chapter 11, he grants Arjuna divine vision, revealing his Vishvarupa, a terrifying and infinite universal form. Arjuna sees entire worlds created and destroyed in an instant. Overwhelmed, he realizes Krishna is beyond a mere teacher or warrior. Krishna reassures him that those who surrender with pure devotion are always protected. In Chapter 12, he clarifies that knowledge and meditation are valuable, but the simplest and most direct path to liberation is love and devotion.\nThoughts # This section shifts from philosophy to an overwhelming display of divine power. Krishna’s universal form is beyond human comprehension, showing that reality is both beautiful and destructive. It reminds me of other traditions where encounters with the divine leave people in awe, like Moses seeing God or Buddhist teachings on impermanence. The three gunas are fascinating because they explain why people act the way they do and how their inner qualities affect spiritual growth. Krishna’s final message is clear. Knowledge and discipline are important, but pure devotion is even greater.\n#### Personal Takeaway The idea that devotion surpasses knowledge is unexpected but makes sense. At some point, reason and logic can only take you so far. Krishna is saying that true peace comes from letting go and trusting something beyond yourself. The universal form also puts things into perspective. Human concerns feel small compared to the vastness of reality. This chapter reinforces the idea that surrendering to something bigger than yourself is not weakness, but the highest form of wisdom.

The Jewish, Islamic, and Christian faiths all have some ties to the Old Testament. This is possibly the most influential book in all of human history. Any journey of intellectualism would be incomplete without a review of this content.\nBooks in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) # The Jewish canon is organized differently from the Christian Old Testament. Also the Masoretic (Jewish) Text does have some wording, order, and emphasis differences from the Greek translation in the Christian bible (Septuagint). Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s broken up a little better and a little more understandable to read in the Greek (Christian) version.\nTorah (Law) # 001 - Genesis 002 - Exodus 003 - Leviticus 004 - Numbers 005 - Deuteronomy Nevi\u0026rsquo;im (Prophets) # 006 - Joshua 007 - Judges 009 - 1 Samuel 010 - 2 Samuel 011 - 1 Kings 012 - 2 Kings 023 - Isaiah 024 - Jeremiah 026 - Ezekiel XXX - The Twelve Minor Prophets (Considered as one book in the Jewish tradition, covering 12 Christian books): 028 - Hosea 029 - Joel 030 - Amos 031 - Obadiah 032 - Jonah 033 - Micah 034 - Nahum 035 - Habakkuk 036 - Zephaniah 037 - Haggai 038 - Zechariah 039 - Malachi Ketuvim (Writings) # 019 - Psalms 020 - Proverbs 018 - Job 022 - Song of Solomon 008 - Ruth 025 - Lamentations 021 - Ecclesiastes 017 - Esther 027 - Daniel XXX - Ezra-Nehemiah (Broken into two books in Christian version) 015 - Ezra 016 - Nehemiah 013 - 1 Chronicles 014 - 2 Chronicles Books in the Christian Old Testament # These are the books that are included in the Protestant, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox canons. The only major changes I saw were additions to Ester and Daniel in the Greek (Christian) version.\nThe Greek (Christian) version includes six additional sections in Ester that elaborate on the religious themes, including prayers by Esther and Mordecai, and explicit mentions of God (which is not in the Hebrew version).\nThere are also three additional sections in the Greek versions of Daniel but not in the Hebrew Bible. The first is \u0026ldquo;The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children\u0026rdquo;. This is inserted into Daniel 3. This addition includes a prayer by Azariah and a hymn of praise by the three men in the fiery furnace. The second addition I saw was \u0026ldquo;Susanna\u0026rdquo;. This is a standalone story of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s wisdom in saving a woman falsely accused of adultery. The last addition was \u0026ldquo;Bel and the Dragon\u0026rdquo;. There are two stories in here that ridicule idolatry and emphasize Daniel\u0026rsquo;s faith in God. There might be other changes, but I probably missed them as I\u0026rsquo;m not really a scholar of religions.\nThe Pentateuch (The Law) # 001 - Genesis 002 - Exodus 003 - Leviticus 004 - Numbers 005 - Deuteronomy Historical Books # 006 - Joshua 007 - Judges 008 - Ruth 009 - 1 Samuel 010 - 2 Samuel 011 - 1 Kings 012 - 2 Kings 013 - 1 Chronicles 014 - 2 Chronicles 015 - Ezra (Combined in Hebrew Bible as part of Ezra-Nehemiah) 016 - Nehemiah (Combined in Hebrew Bible as part of Ezra-Nehemiah) 017 - Esther Wisdom and Poetry # 018 - Job 019 - Psalms 020 - Proverbs 021 - Ecclesiastes 022 - Song of Solomon The Prophetic Books # Major Prophets # 023 - Isaiah 024 - Jeremiah 025 - Lamentations 026 - Ezekiel 027 - Daniel Minor Prophets # 028 - Hosea 029 - Joel 030 - Amos 031 - Obadiah 032 - Jonah 033 - Micah 034 - Nahum 035 - Habakkuk 036 - Zephaniah 037 - Haggai 038 - Zechariah 039 - Malachi Deuterocanonical Books # These are books accepted in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles, but not in the Protestant canon.\n040 - Tobit 041 - Judith 042 - Wisdom of Solomon 043 - Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 044 - Baruch 045 - 1 Maccabees 046 - 2 Maccabees 047 - Additions to Esther (Additional passages in the Septuagint version of Esther) 048 - Additions to Daniel: 048a - The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children 048b - Susanna 048c - Bel and the Dragon Eastern Orthodox Additional Books # The below are books recognized by the Eastern Orthodox Church but not in the Catholic or Protestant Bibles.\n049 - 1 Esdras 050 - 2 Esdras (Apocalypse of Ezra) 051 - Prayer of Manasseh (Sometimes included with 2 Chronicles) 052 - Psalm 151 (Found in some versions of the Psalms) Relevant Dead Sea Scroll Texts # Some of the texts found in the Dead Sea Scrolls include variants or additional manuscripts of the books included in the Old Testament. They are important for understanding the textual history of these books.\n053 - Genesis Apocryphon (Expands on the Book of Genesis, telling the stories of Noah, Abraham, and others) 054 - The War Scroll (Describes an apocalyptic war between the \u0026ldquo;Sons of Light\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Sons of Darkness,\u0026rdquo; which expands the context of the Hebrew Bible’s eschatological themes) 055 - The Psalms Scroll (Contains copies of several Psalms, along with some previously unknown psalms) 056 - The Book of Enoch (Not part of the Hebrew Bible or Christian Old Testament, but it provides insight into Jewish thought during the Second Temple period) 057 - The Book of Tobit (A version of the Deuterocanonical Book of Tobit was found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, though it is sometimes thought to have been in the canon of certain Jewish sects) 058 - The Community Rule (Describes the rules and practices of the Dead Sea Scrolls community, often linked to the Essenes, with similarities to teachings found in parts of the Old Testament) 059 - The Copper Scroll (Lists locations where treasures are supposedly hidden, presenting historical and religious significance) Books in Islam # Islam does not directly adopt the Old Testament but acknowledges certain scriptures and stories within it, often through the lens of the Quran. Islam sees the Quran as the final and uncorrupted revelation, superseding the Torah, Psalms, and other previous scriptures. Stories and teachings from the Old Testament are often retold in the Quran with theological differences. As a result I don\u0026rsquo;t really go through this too deeply. However, it important to recognise that this relationship exists.\nRecognized Scriptures Tawrah (Torah): Given to Musa (Moses) and acknowledged as divine guidance. Zabur (Psalms): Given to Dawud (David) as hymns of praise. Recognized Prophets and Figures (Shared with Old Testament) Adam and Eve: The creation story and fall. Nuh (Noah): The flood narrative. Ibrahim (Abraham): The patriarch of monotheism. Yusuf (Joseph): His trials in Egypt. Musa (Moses): His role in leading the Israelites out of Egypt. Dawud (David) and Sulaiman (Solomon): Kings and prophets. Ayyub (Job): A model of patience. Yunus (Jonah): His story with the whale.
