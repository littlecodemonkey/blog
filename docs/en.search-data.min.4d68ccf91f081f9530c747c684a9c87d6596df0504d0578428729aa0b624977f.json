This is a Sumerian poem about Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk and ruled around 2700 BCE. This story was spoken and told orally, but clay tablets have been found. The tablets date back to around 2100 BCE. They are written in a cuneiform script called Akkadian. This was the Semitic language used in the Assyrian and Babylonian Around 1200 BCE, and the tablets were then compiled into their most complete form and into one single story by a Babylonian priest named Sin-Leqi-Unninni around 1200 BCE. These were multiple tales that were compiled into a larger story. Fragments were found all over Mesopotamia, so this story was widespread. The most complete version is called the \u0026ldquo;Standard Babylonian Version,\u0026rdquo; and it was discovered in Ashurbanipal\u0026rsquo;s library (an Assyrian king). This was discovered around the mid-19th century.\nThere are twelve tablets. This is very significant as its stories parallel later works. A major one is the Bible\u0026rsquo;s story of the flood in Genesis. The story also mirrors the Greek myth where Deucalion and his wife survive a great flood sent by Zeus and repopulate the Earth, although the story of Noah is much closer to Gilgamesh. A flood story predates Gilgamesh, and that\u0026rsquo;s the Mesopotamian Epic myth of Atrahasis. A god tells Atrahasis to build a boat to survive a flood meant to wipe out humanity.\nPersonal Takeaway # I read a few versions of this epic, and one of my favorite was the graphic novel version. The depiction of the Humbaba battle is fantastic. The new English translation by Stephen Mitchell was also quite good. It is much more readable than some of the older versions. Reading these first helped me understand the story and made the others more readable after knowing what was going on. Some of the versions are more raw and include more of the sexuality, humor, and tough concepts like Gilgamesh\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;first right\u0026rdquo; to women on their wedding day.\nSome of the versions tend to make this more academic, and some of the sexuality and humor is dropped. This was an incredible story that passed down through generations.\nUtnapishtim is brought in as if the reader/listener already knows who he is. It\u0026rsquo;s as if he\u0026rsquo;s the main charater in the previous epic that\u0026rsquo;s brought in for a cameo appearance. After researching more about this, he mentions that while he was a king his name was \u0026ldquo;Atra-Hasis\u0026rdquo;, which basically translates to \u0026ldquo;Exceedingly/Extraordinarily Wise\u0026rdquo;. This was the main character in the previous epic Atrahasis. In this Atra-Hasis is chosen by the god Enki (Ea) as well, to build an ark as well, to survive the flood. It\u0026rsquo;s very clear the reader is supposed to know him as the main character from this other epic. Atrahasis is a much older epic and Utnapishtim is a very old man in the Epic of Gilgamesh.\nThe epic of Atrahasis that I found (a translation by Stephanie Dalley) was only about 30 pages and quite an easy read. It was not part of the Brodsky challenge, but well worth the read to figure out similarities here.\nBook Summary # Tablet I: Introduction and Gilgamesh\u0026rsquo;s Rule # Gilgamesh is described as a demi-god. He\u0026rsquo;s two-thirds god and one-third human. He is strong and massive in size. However, he\u0026rsquo;s very oppressive. One of the rights of the king is called \u0026ldquo;first rights\u0026rdquo;. First rights are royal privileges, and the right a king has to be the first of anything. The first to resources, the first to food, and the first to fruits of labor. Gilgamesh abused this by claiming the virginity of women on their wedding night. The people of Uruk feel he abused his first rights, but this one is the one they resented the most.\nIn response to the people\u0026rsquo;s complaints, the gods created a wild man to confront him. This wild man is named Enkidu. Enkidu ends up being tricked into joining the human world by having sex with a human. The local farmer/hunter hired a prostitute to have sex with Enkidu so that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a wild animal anymore.\nTablet II: Enkidu\u0026rsquo;s Civilizing and Meeting with Gilgamesh # Enkidu is a huge man. The temple prostitute (Shamat) seduces Enkidu and brings Enkidu to challenge Gilgamesh. Enkidu stands at the doorway to a chapel to prevent Gilgamesh from claiming first rights to a bride, and they get into a fistfight. Gilgamesh barely wins. However, he grows as a person from the fight and the two become best friends out of mutual respect.\nTablet III: The Quest for Cedarwood # Gilgamesh, seeking fame, proposes a dangerous expedition to the Cedar Forest to confront its guardian, Humbaba. Enkidu and the elders of Uruk initially warn against it, but Gilgamesh insists. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting that Enkidu already knew of the dangers of the forest, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure where he would have learned of this, but he suddenly had knowledge of it. This was probably to make the story more suspenseful and make it sound more dangerous. Not a lot really happens in this tablet.\nTablet IV: Journey to the Cedar Forest # Gilgamesh and Enkidu travel to the Cedar Forest. Along the way, Gilgamesh experiences troubling dreams that Enkidu interprets as favorable omens. There are a lot of dreams in the Epic of Gilgamesh. This is no different. This is a main reason why I think tablet XII (12) fits in as a dream sequence.\nTablet V: The Battle with Humbaba # The two men confront and defeat Humbaba with divine assistance. They earn a tony of glory from this. Humbaba asks for mercy, but Gilgamesh does not spare him. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting that Humbaba pleads for his life, and Gilgamesh feels like the bad guy at a point. The monster (ogre) is clearly intelligent and speaks language. It feels a little like murder at the end. Perhaps this just didn\u0026rsquo;t age well.\nTablet VI: The Bull of Heaven and Ishtar\u0026rsquo;s Rejection # This is hilarious. The goddess Ishtar really goes after Gilgamesh. She\u0026rsquo;s tries really hard to romantically get involved with him. Gilgamesh then rejects her harshly. He brings up her past lovers and mocks her. She gets very angry and sends the Bull of Heaven to punish him. Gilgamesh and Enkidu slay the bull. This book is meant to be quite funny and there is a lot of entertainment here. I can imagine this story being told around Summarian campfires.\nTablet VII: The Death of Enkidu # The gods decide Enkidu must die as punishment for killing Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven. Enkidu falls ill and curses the events that led him to civilization but ultimately accepts his fate and dies. There is some foreshaddowing here as Enkidu goes a little crazy he starts talking nonsense, but there is some foreshadowing to Utnapishtim here.\nI had always understood that wedding rings were first associated with the Romans or with the \u0026ldquo;rings of love\u0026rdquo; from the Egyptians, who are sometimes credited with exchanging rings as symbols of love. However, while reading the Epic of Gilgamesh, I came across a passage in Tablet VIII that states, \u0026ldquo;of the wife place a ring on you, mourn you.\u0026rdquo; This could be referring to wedding rings, or I could be misunderstanding this.\nTablet VIII: Mourning Enkidu # Gilgamesh mourns deeply for his friend. He ends up building a monument for him as well. This shows the friendship between the two being one of intense emotion. Ancient Mesopotamian literature often blurred lines between intense friendship and romantic love. The texts talk about an intense emotional and physical relationship between the two. It reminds me of the relationship between David and Jonathon in the Old Testament. There are more undertones of a possible physical closeness between Gilgamesh and Enkidu than between David and Jonathon. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that either or both couples were gay, or maybe neither was. Intense friendships between men were a common thing in the past.\nDavid declares that Jonathan’s love was \u0026ldquo;wonderful, surpassing the love of women\u0026rdquo; (2 Samuel 1:26). I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure culturally what he means by that as I\u0026rsquo;m not as familiar with ancient Near Eastern culture, but in a more modern lens it does read as a highly emotional bond. I\u0026rsquo;ll unpack this more as I re-read the Old Testament.\nTablet IX: The Quest for Immortality # Gilgamesh now fears death after the death of Enkidu. He set\u0026rsquo;s out on a quest for immortality. He looks to find the only one he know of that has lived forever. This is the Mesopotanian version of Noah called Utnapistim. He was granted imortality by the gods. There are these half men half scorpians that he meets, that end up being helpful rather than evil. Gilgamesh then spends 10 hours traveling through pitch darkness to arrive in another place.\nTablet X: Meeting with Siduri and the Boatman # Gilgamesh encounters Siduri, a tavern keeper, who advises him to accept mortality. She is quite kind and Gilgamesh might be better off to just live his days out with her. He moves on howevers, and meets Urshanabi, the ferryman, who helps him cross the waters of death to reach Utnapishtim.\nTablet XI: Utnapishtim\u0026rsquo;s Story and the Secret of Immortality # Utnapishtim recounts the story of a great flood and how he and his wife were granted immortality by the gods. Utnapishtim then challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for seven days as a test, which he fails. Gilgamesh sleeps for all seven days, and Utnapishtim sets out bread that molds in various ways to prove he\u0026rsquo;d been asleep the whole time. Gilgamesh leaves, but as a gift for coming so far Utnapishtim tells him about a plant at the bottom of the water that can restore youth. Gilgamesh finds it, but then a snake steals it. (This feels very biblical too.) Gilgamesh immediatly gives up and returns to Uruk. The story is attempting to show he is accepting his mortality and taking pride in his legacy, but it just feels as he\u0026rsquo;s giving up.\nTablet XII (Appendix, not always included): Enkidu\u0026rsquo;s Spirit # A later addition, possibly unrelated to the main story, describing a conversation between Gilgamesh and Enkidu\u0026rsquo;s spirit. In this Gilgamesh asks a lot of questions about how the dead are doing and Enkidu describes them. I like to read this as if Gilgamesh is in a dream sequence as it makes more sense this way. Also there are a lot of dreams in this story so it makes sense.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/blog/docs/reading/brodsky_challenge/999_other_texts/001_old_man_and_the_sea/","title":"001 Old Man and the Sea","section":"999 Other Texts","content":" The Old Man and the Sea # By Ernest Hemingway\nOverview # Summary # \u0026ldquo;The Old Man and the Sea\u0026rdquo; is one of Ernest Hemingway\u0026rsquo;s most famous works. It was published in 1952, and this year for Christmas my buddy Wayne gifted my a first edition of the Novel. It\u0026rsquo;s a fairly short books, and less than 200 pages. It tells the story of an old man in a Cuban fishing village. This is a story of struggle, and it starts with the fisherman going 84 days without catching a fish.\nThoughts # Reading \u0026ldquo;The Old Man and the Sea\u0026rdquo; provides a deep reflection on the human spirit and its enduring quest for meaning. Santiago’s struggle with the marlin reminded me of the personal battles we all face, whether in careers, relationships, or life itself. There’s something profoundly human in the way Santiago perseveres, even in the face of overwhelming odds. It is also interesting to consider how Hemingway uses minimalism to create such depth, often leaving much unsaid. The idea that every victory can be hollow yet still worth pursuing resonates strongly.\nPersonal Takeaway # In a way, this feels like a story of meritocracy. Where the old man is successful because of his effort and perseverance. Despite his age and bad luck, his determination leads to his success in catching a big fish. It also is a story on how that meritocracy can be influced by external sources, especially related to the sharks. Merit and success are sometimes met with challenges beyond one\u0026rsquo;s control, but as long as you remain diligent you will be successful in honor.\nThe Story # The Old Man and the Boy # The old man befrinds a little boy, and the boy helps him fish for years. The boy, Manolin, is now forced to fish with another person because his parents believe the old man is unlucky in catching fish. The boy really cares for the old man, and there is a genuine feeling of love between them.\nThere is a lot of talk about American baseball, and the old man is a fan of DiMaggio. The old man teaches the boy dignity and pride in this.\nThe Struggle Begins # On the 85th day without a fish, the old man goes out in his skiff. He catches an enormous marlin. The fish pulls on the boat for hours, and the old man cannot reel it in. The old man doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a pole. He brings it in with a handline. The old man\u0026rsquo;s hands get torn up and bleed. At points he believes he is going to lose fingers. The conflict is very real, and the unwavering resolve of the fisherman to handle the pain is admirable.\nThe old man talks of memories, and as he fights, he wishes the boy was there to help over and over again. His mental resolve is incredible.\nVictory and Loss # After three days and nights of struggle, the old man finally catches the marlin. He ties it alongside his skiff and heads back in the way of Cuba. He has to guess which way the island is because he was drug so far off course. Sharks attack the marlin, and he loses a lot of it. Then, right before he pulls into the port, sharks come back and attack it again. There\u0026rsquo;s basically nothing left but a skeleton. It\u0026rsquo;s quite sad.\nReturn and Reflection # After the fight, the old man returns home and goes to sleep. He leaves the carcass tied to his boat. The boy visits him because he was worried the old man left three days ago. The whole village is talking about the enormous fish. Even though the old man is beaten up, he still has his pride as he felt he fought honorably.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/blog/docs/reading/brodsky_challenge/001_bhagavad_gita/","title":"001 Bhagavad Gita","section":"Brodsky Challenge","content":" Bhagavad Gita # By Vyasa\nOverview # Summary # The Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual book from around 200 BC. It was written by a man named Vyasa. As I looked deeper into this work, I found that I needed the context of where this book came from.\nThis book appears to be a 700 verse excerpt from a larger work called the Mahabharata. This is truly an epic poem and is thousands of pages long. It reads very much like a relegious text to me.\nBasically, in the larger poem leading up to these events, it appears there was a king named Vichitravirya. He had multiple wives. He had some children, but one took a vow not to be the king. The writer of the epic, Vyasa, impregneates the queen after the king\u0026rsquo;s death in order to create an heir. This is apparently a traditional practice called Niyoga.\nThe oldest son was born blind, and there were two more sons. When the king died of a sickness, they didn\u0026rsquo;t want the blind son to be king, so Vidura (a wise sage) picked the younger son Pandu to be king. Pandu ends up retiring into the forest and the Blind son (Dhritarashtra) becomes king.\nAt one point the Pandavas are apparently killed, so the blind king picks a different successor. It turns out they weren\u0026rsquo;t really killed at all, and they come back asking for the kingdom. They end up playing a dice game for the kingdom and losing, and then are exiled for 13 years. When they come back from exile 13 years later, they fight a war to regain the kingdom.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very chaotic and there is a lot going on. Historically, it mostly seems plausable except for a lot of the talk of Gods and super powers in strength and such. It\u0026rsquo;s so politically chaotic and they all seem to have at least some claim to the throne that even Krishna himself (God in mortal form) can\u0026rsquo;t choose a side. Krishna offers his armies to one side and himself as a guide to the other side to be as fair as possible.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where the Gita picks up, at the battlefield of this great war. Krishna is hauling the chariot of a great archer and warrior, Arjuna.\nThoughts # The Bhagavad Gita basically depicts a dialogue between Arjuna (this warrior) and Krishna (God in mortal form), while between two giant armies, immediately prior to the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and Kauravas.\nThe book seems best broken to me into three sections, chapters 1-6 (about the knowledge of self), chapters 7-12 (devotion to Krishna), and chapters 13-18 (relationship between atman and god, and the 3 qualities of creation).\nPart 1 (Chapters 1-6) # This one is the easiest for me to break up. This one is pretty obvious and talks quite a bit on the self.\nBook Summary # Chapter 1 # Summary # Krishna is hauling the chariot of Arjuna, and Arjuna feels like a badass and wants to be taken to the front lines to see the other side. There he sees relatives on both sides of the battle and it hits him hard. He knows that a lot of people are going to die, and he loses the will to fight. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to kill the people he loves and feels that life is worthless if he can\u0026rsquo;t spend it with his family. He thinks he\u0026rsquo;s better off being killed without a fight and lays down his bow and slumps into his chariot.\nThoughts # After reading three different versions, the only part that caught me as difficult to comprehend was the family tradition talk. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I read a new translation by Flood and Martin that it made sense. They are talking about the caste system in India. Everyone in power is part of the highest caste and there is talk that the world will go into ruin if the blood is polluted. As a westerner, it caught me a little offguard. I figure that I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have more of these cultural concerns as I go down this journey, but I have to admit that it was surprising. Reading these books in the context of the history and cultures they were written in will force me to drop some biases and ethnocentrism.\nPersonal Takeaway # One thing that really resonated and was timely about this was the fact that Krishna waited until Arjuna was in a horrible place in his life, and right in the middle of the battle to show him wisdom and tell him about God. If he was all powerful, why did he wait until this moment? There had to have been a better time. It made me think, and perhaps even realize, that maybe the timing was right. Sometimes you need to be in the right state of mind to accept knowledge. Perhaps, I myself wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gotten this out of the text had I read it earlier in life, when I was younger and had less experiences, so maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a point to me going through this literary journey at this exact point in my life.\nChapter 2 # Summary # This is about the practice of \u0026ldquo;yoga\u0026rdquo;. This continues the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna. Arjuna is still hesitant to go to war. Krishna first tells him that he needs to be more of a man or he won\u0026rsquo;t go to heaven. Arjuna, decides to not fight and Krishna changes tactics to take a more intellectual approach and explain more to Arjuna in detail.\nThe Soul - This talks a little about reincarnation at the beginning. About how our soul finds new bodies after death, and that while the body is affected by \u0026ldquo;weapons, fire, water, and air\u0026rdquo; the soul is not. It is never born and doesn\u0026rsquo;t die. It is forever and unchanging. There is some contradiction later where Krishna says even if the soul is born and dies you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t morn it because all things eventually end.\nThe Dharma - Dharma appears to be a relegious or moral duty from the text. It\u0026rsquo;s listed as the responsibilities of a warrior (Kshritya). Krishna basically tells Arjuna to \u0026ldquo;man up\u0026rdquo; and be stronger. A lot of this is about honor and that disgrace is a fear worse than death. There is a logic that, if he fights for this Dharma and dies he will go to heaven, and if he wins and lives then he will also win and gain great wealth.\nThe Kharma - Krishna tells Arjuna to not think about fighting and just fight. If he acts without thinking of the reprecussions he can act without fear and his brain won\u0026rsquo;t go haywire. Krishna then goes on to say that he should not worry about what he will gain from the action, that when action is performed for simply the action\u0026rsquo;s sake without the thought of success or failure, it is called Yoga. He mentions that Yoga is liberating to the mind and body. Once you learn how to act without thinking then he won\u0026rsquo;t need to learn anything from scriptures.\nThe Senses - When the mind is untroubled, unattached from all things, and the person just acts, then that\u0026rsquo;s a person of firm wisdom. He should avoid all senses and not dwell on senses because then he will desire things, desiring things leads to attachment of things, and attachment of things leads to anger, anger can lead to confusion and then weakness.\nThe goal here seems to be serenity. He basically is trying to get Arjuna to calm down and gain control over his senses and emotions so that he can clear his mind.\nThoughts # This seems very similar to some of the stuff the stocis say, and I\u0026rsquo;m really interested to follow up with the works of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurillus later and compare notes to this. I can also see a lot of where modern yoga came out of this book. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot in modern yoga about clearing the mind and avoiding attachments. The stuff on centering yourself and clearing your thoughts is facinating. You can really see how Krishna would be trying to convince him that everything was ok, and he could go ahead and fight.\nPersonal Takeaway # Chapter 2 seems to be the most powerful in the whole book. There are some real interesting topics about the individual and how a person should act and think. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible how more of these are applicable thousands of years later.\nChapter 3 # Summary # Chapter three is the Yoga of Action.

The Jewish canon is organized differently from the Christian Old Testament. Also the Masoretic Text does have some wording, order, and emphasis differences from the Greek translation in the Christian bible (Septuagint). Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s broken up a little better and a little more understandable to read in the Greek (Christian) version.\nThe only major changes I saw were additions to Ester and Daniel in the Greek (Christian) version.\nThe Greek (Christian) version includes six additional sections in Ester that elaborate on the religious themes, including prayers by Esther and Mordecai, and explicit mentions of God (which is not in the Hebrew version).\nThere are also three additional sections in the Greek versions of Daniel but not in the Hebrew Bible. The first is \u0026ldquo;The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children\u0026rdquo;. This is inserted into Daniel 3. This addition includes a prayer by Azariah and a hymn of praise by the three men in the fiery furnace. The second addition I saw was \u0026ldquo;Susanna\u0026rdquo;. This is a standalone story of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s wisdom in saving a woman falsely accused of adultery. The last addition was \u0026ldquo;Bel and the Dragon\u0026rdquo;. There are two stories in here that ridicule idolatry and emphasize Daniel\u0026rsquo;s faith in God. There might be other changes, but I probably missed them as I\u0026rsquo;m not really a scholar of religions.\nTorah (Law) # 001 - Genesis (Duplicate in Christian Old Testament) 002 - Exodus (Duplicate in Christian Old Testament) 003 -
