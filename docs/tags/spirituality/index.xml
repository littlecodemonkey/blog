      <description>Bhagavad Gita #  By Vyasa
Summary #  The Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual book from around 200 BC. It was written by a man named Vyasa. As I looked deeper into this work, I found that I needed the context of where this book came from.
This book appears to be a 700 verse excerpt from a larger work called the Mahabharata. This is truly an epic poem and is thousands of pages long.</description>
