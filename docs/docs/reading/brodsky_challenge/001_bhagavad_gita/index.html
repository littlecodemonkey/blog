</h4>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual book from around 200 BC. It was written by a man named Vyasa. As I looked deeper into
this work, I found that I needed the context of where this book came from.</p>
<p>This book appears to be a 700 verse excerpt from a larger work called the Mahabharata. This is truly an epic poem and
is thousands of pages long. It reads very much like a relegious text to me.</p>
<p>Basically, in the larger poem leading up to these events, it appears there was a king named Vichitravirya. He had
multiple wives. He had some children, but one took a vow not to be the king. The writer of the epic, Vyasa,
impregneates the queen after the king&rsquo;s death in order to create an heir. This is apparently a traditional practice
called Niyoga.</p>
<p>The oldest son was born blind, and there were two more sons. When the king died of a sickness, they didn&rsquo;t want the
blind son to be king, so Vidura (a wise sage) picked the younger son Pandu to be king. Pandu ends up retiring into the
forest and the Blind son (Dhritarashtra) becomes king.</p>
<p>At one point the Pandavas are apparently killed, so the blind king picks a different successor. It turns out they
weren&rsquo;t really killed at all, and they come back asking for the kingdom. They end up playing a dice game for the
kingdom and losing, and then are exiled for 13 years. When they come back from exile 13 years later, they fight a war
to regain the kingdom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very chaotic and there is a lot going on. Historically, it mostly seems plausable except for a lot of the talk of
Gods and super powers in strength and such. It&rsquo;s so politically chaotic and they all seem to have at least some claim
to the throne that even Krishna himself (God in mortal form) can&rsquo;t choose a side. Krishna offers his armies to one side
and himself as a guide to the other side to be as fair as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the Gita picks up, at the battlefield of this great war. Krishna is hauling the chariot of a great archer
and warrior, Arjuna.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts">
  Thoughts
  <a class="anchor" href="#thoughts">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita basically depicts a dialogue between Arjuna (this warrior) and Krishna (God in mortal form), while
between two giant armies, immediately prior to the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and Kauravas.</p>
<p>The book seems best broken to me into three sections, chapters 1-6 (about the knowledge of self), chapters 7-12
(devotion to Krishna), and chapters 13-18 (relationship between atman and god, and the 3 qualities of creation).</p>

</h4>
<p>Krishna is hauling the chariot of Arjuna, and Arjuna feels like a badass and wants to be taken to the front lines to
see the other side. There he sees relatives on both sides of the battle and it hits him hard. He knows that a lot of
people are going to die, and he loses the will to fight. He doesn&rsquo;t want to kill the people he loves and feels that
life is worthless if he can&rsquo;t spend it with his family. He thinks he&rsquo;s better off being killed without a fight and lays
down his bow and slumps into his chariot.</p>

<p>After reading three different versions, the only part that caught me as difficult to comprehend was the family
tradition talk. It wasn&rsquo;t until I read a new translation by Flood and Martin that it made sense. They are talking
about the caste system in India. Everyone in power is part of the highest caste and there is talk that the world will
go into ruin if the blood is polluted. As a westerner, it caught me a little offguard. I figure that I&rsquo;ll probably have
more of these cultural concerns as I go down this journey, but I have to admit that it was surprising. Reading these
books in the context of the history and cultures they were written in will force me to drop some biases and
ethnocentrism.</p>

  Personal Takeaway
  <a class="anchor" href="#personal-takeaway">#</a>
</h4>
<p>One thing that really resonated and was timely about this was the fact that Krishna waited until Arjuna was in a
horrible place in his life, and right in the middle of the battle to show him wisdom and tell him about God. If he was
all powerful, why did he wait until this moment? There had to have been a better time. It made me think, and perhaps
even realize, that maybe the timing was right. Sometimes you need to be in the right state of mind to accept knowledge.
Perhaps, I myself wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten this out of the text had I read it earlier in life, when I was younger and had
less experiences, so maybe there&rsquo;s a point to me going through this literary journey at this exact point in my life.</p>

  Chapter 2

<h4 id="summary-2">
  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary-2">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This is about the practice of &ldquo;yoga&rdquo;. This continues the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna. Arjuna is still
hesitant to go to war. Krishna first tells him that he needs to be more of a man or he won&rsquo;t go to heaven. Arjuna,
decides to not fight and Krishna changes tactics to take a more intellectual approach and explain more to Arjuna in
detail.</p>
<p>The Soul -
This talks a little about reincarnation at the beginning. About how our soul finds new bodies after death, and that
while the body is affected by &ldquo;weapons, fire, water, and air&rdquo; the soul is not. It is never born and doesn&rsquo;t die. It is
forever and unchanging. There is some contradiction later where Krishna says even if the soul is born and dies you
shouldn&rsquo;t morn it because all things eventually end.</p>
<p>The Dharma -
Dharma appears to be a relegious or moral duty from the text. It&rsquo;s listed as the responsibilities of a warrior
(Kshritya). Krishna basically tells Arjuna to &ldquo;man up&rdquo; and be stronger. A lot of this is about honor and that disgrace
is a fear worse than death. There is a logic that, if he fights for this Dharma and dies he will go to heaven, and if
he wins and lives then he will also win and gain great wealth.</p>
<p>The Kharma -
Krishna tells Arjuna to not think about fighting and just fight. If he acts without thinking of the reprecussions he
can act without fear and his brain won&rsquo;t go haywire. Krishna then goes on to say that he should not worry about what he
will gain from the action, that when action is performed for simply the action&rsquo;s sake without the thought of success or
failure, it is called Yoga. He mentions that Yoga is liberating to the mind and body. Once you learn how to act without
thinking then he won&rsquo;t need to learn anything from scriptures.</p>
<p>The Senses -
When the mind is untroubled, unattached from all things, and the person just acts, then that&rsquo;s a person of firm wisdom.
He should avoid all senses and not dwell on senses because then he will desire things, desiring things leads to
attachment of things, and attachment of things leads to anger, anger can lead to confusion and then weakness.</p>
<p>The goal here seems to be serenity. He basically is trying to get Arjuna to calm down and gain control over his senses
and emotions so that he can clear his mind.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-2">
  Thoughts
  <a class="anchor" href="#thoughts-2">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This seems very similar to some of the stuff the stocis say, and I&rsquo;m really interested to follow up with the works of
Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurillus later and compare notes to this. I can also see a lot of where modern yoga came
out of this book. There&rsquo;s a lot in modern yoga about clearing the mind and avoiding attachments. The stuff on
centering yourself and clearing your thoughts is facinating. You can really see how Krishna would be trying to convince
him that everything was ok, and he could go ahead and fight.</p>

  Personal Takeaway
  <a class="anchor" href="#personal-takeaway-1">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Chapter 2 seems to be the most powerful in the whole book. There are some real interesting topics about the individual
and how a person should act and think. It&rsquo;s incredible how more of these are applicable thousands of years later.</p>

<h4 id="summary-3">
  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary-3">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Chapter three is the Yoga of Action. Arjun ask at the beginning to Krishna, if you consider knowledge superior to action
then why do you ask me to wage this terrible war? At this point Arjun is still trying to get out of fighting the war.</p>
<p>Krishna explains there are two paths to Yoga.  Te path of knowledge, for those inclined toward contemplation, and the
path of work for those inclined toward action. He mentions that one cannot obtain freedom from karmic reactions from
merely not acting, nor can one attain perfect knowledge by mere physical renunciation. Basically what he is saying here
is that action is something you can&rsquo;t avoid. Even maintain the body requires action of some sort.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a concept here called Nishkama Karma introduced as well. Basically this is performing actions without an
attachment to the results. It promotes selfless action. There is a mention that if you&rsquo;re a good person just to get
into heaven, then you probably won&rsquo;t get into heaven. You have to be a good person without any expectations. You are
entitled to your work, but don&rsquo;t feel entitled to the fruits of your labor. You should see the work you do as a
service to society. Chapter 3, Verse 19 sums this up&hellip; &ldquo;Therefore, without attachment, do your duty, because by
working without attachment, one attains the Supreme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main obstacles to spiritual progress are listed as desire (Kama) and anger (Krodha). Krishna advises to master
these through self-discipline and self awareness.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-3">
  Thoughts
  <a class="anchor" href="#thoughts-3">#</a>
</h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here. The main thing is that you shouldn&rsquo;t do things for the outcome of those things. You
should be doing things because you feel this is the best way to live.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the book &ldquo;No More Mr. Nice Guy&rdquo; by Dr. Robert Glover. I read this book right after my divorce and
it was very inciteful. He states that &ldquo;nicy guys&rdquo; often act out of covert contracts. An idea of &ldquo;if I do this, someone
else with do this&rdquo;. They expect approval, validation, or some form of reciprocation in return. There&rsquo;s a thought here
to take responsibility for ones one actions and live authentically, rather than seeking external validation. This very
much aligns with the advice in the Gita to act without an attachment to the results. Instead the person should be
focusing on doing what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint warning">
<h4 id="personal-takeaway-2">

  <a class="anchor" href="#personal-takeaway-2">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Krishna also talks about performing one&rsquo;s individual duty (Swa-Dharma) rather than trying to mimic others. No More Mr.
Nice Guy mentions that &ldquo;nice guys&rdquo; often neglect their own needs to fit into other&rsquo;s expectations of them, or societal
molds. The book talks about finding and following your own true purpose instead of seeking approval or avoiding
conflict. I&rsquo;m not certain if Dr. Glover read the Gita, but there are many parallels between his book and this chapter
of the Gita.</p>

<p>Krishna shifts from talking about action to knowledge, revealing that the wisdom he’s sharing is ancient but was lost
over time. Then he drops the big reveal; he’s God in human form, here to restore Dharma. He tells Arjuna that whenever
righteousness declines, he manifests to set things right, protect the good, and destroy evil. This introduces Jnana
Karma Sanyasa, the idea that true renunciation isn’t about avoiding action but acting with knowledge and detachment.
He expands on sacrifice (yajna) beyond traditional rituals, explaining that real sacrifice includes giving up ego,
desires, and even attachment to knowledge itself. The key takeaway: if Arjuna surrenders to divine wisdom, he’ll be
free from past karma and can move forward without fear.</p>

<p>Krishna takes things up a notch here, shifting from philosophy to straight-up divine authority. He’s not just giving
advice anymore. He’s saying, I’m God, trust me. The idea that God shows up to restore balance when things go off the
rails has a mythological feel, reminding me of similar themes in other religions. The part about sacrificing knowledge
is unexpected. Krishna has been preaching wisdom, and now he’s saying not to cling to it too tightly. That tracks with
the Zen “beginner’s mind” idea. True wisdom comes from letting go of rigid thinking. Also, the surrender to divine will
here feels like an early version of Bhakti (devotion), similar to Christian ideas of grace. Trusting in something higher
wipes away past mistakes.</p>

</h4>
<p>This chapter refines the previous message: act with knowledge, but don’t get attached to outcomes. The deeper idea on
sacrifice also hit me. People give up time, money, and energy all the time, but Krishna is talking about giving up ego
and the need for control. That’s real freedom. Also, his message about past mistakes is powerful. You’re not bound by
who you used to be, you can start fresh. This makes me want to explore more on Bhakti philosophy and also compare it
to Stoicism, especially Epictetus, who emphasizes controlling what’s in your power and surrendering the rest.</p>

</h4>
<p>Arjuna is still unsure whether renouncing action or acting without attachment is the better path. Krishna tells him
that both lead to the same goal, but acting without attachment is superior because it is more practical. True
renunciation isn’t about avoiding responsibilities but about performing one’s duty without selfish motives. A person
who works while surrendering the results is truly free. Krishna explains that a wise person sees no real difference
between success and failure, pleasure and pain, or even friend and enemy. Those who master this mindset attain inner
peace and unity with the divine.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-5">

  <a class="anchor" href="#thoughts-5">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This chapter makes it clear that renunciation is not about inaction but about mindset. Krishna shows that enlightenment
isn’t found by withdrawing from the world but by fully engaging in it without attachment. That reminds me of Stoicism,
especially Marcus Aurelius, who emphasizes doing one’s duty without concern for rewards or recognition. The idea that a
wise person treats all experiences equally is tough to grasp but makes sense if the goal is inner peace. If you are not
constantly chasing pleasure or avoiding discomfort, you remain steady no matter what happens.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson here is that peace comes from letting go of control, not from avoiding responsibility. This applies
to everything whether work, relationships, or personal goals. Focusing on effort rather than results keeps you from
getting caught up in disappointment and frustration. This connects to modern ideas about mindfulness and flow, where
success comes from being fully present in the process. Krishna keeps repeating this message, and I see why. It is
simple but one of the hardest things to actually live by.</p>

<p>Krishna shifts focus to meditation as the key to self-mastery. He explains that the true yogi is not someone who simply
renounces the world but someone who balances action and detachment. A real yogi neither avoids responsibility nor
becomes obsessed with results. Instead, they stay steady in all situations, free from attachment and ego. He describes
meditation as the ultimate path to self-realization, where the mind is disciplined and focused only on the divine. The
best meditator is one who sees all beings as equal and recognizes the presence of the divine in everyone. Krishna ends
by declaring that of all yogis, those who surrender to him with devotion are the highest.</p>

<p>This chapter brings everything together. Krishna has been telling Arjuna to act without attachment, but now he’s
explaining how to do it through meditation. The way he describes it makes it clear that meditation isn’t just about
sitting in silence but about training the mind to stay calm and focused. This connects to a lot of modern mindfulness
and Stoic ideas. Marcus Aurelius talks about keeping the mind steady no matter what happens, which is exactly what
Krishna is saying. The idea that the best yogi sees everyone as equal also stands out. It reinforces that detachment
doesn’t mean indifference. It means seeing things clearly and acting with compassion instead of impulse.</p>

<p>Krishna’s message about balance really resonates. It’s not about extreme renunciation or blind ambition but about
being steady no matter what life throws at you. Meditation isn’t just about closing your eyes and breathing; it’s
about building the mental strength to stay centered in the middle of chaos. That applies to everything. work,
relationships, even personal struggles. Krishna keeps pushing the idea that the highest path isn’t just knowledge or
action but a combination of both, grounded in discipline and focus. It’s easy to see why meditation has become such a
central part of so many spiritual traditions.</p>

  Summary

</h4>
<p>Krishna moves from self-discipline and meditation to bhakti, or devotion. He explains that everything in existence,
both material and spiritual, comes from him. Some people seek him for selfish reasons, while others seek him with
wisdom and love. He introduces the three gunas-sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance). These shape
human behavior. Those who transcend these qualities through devotion achieve liberation.</p>
<p>Krishna describes himself as the ultimate reality behind all things. He is time, creation, destruction, and the source
of all wisdom. In Chapter 10, he lists the ways he manifests in the world, from the Himalayas to the power of speech.
In Chapter 11, he grants Arjuna divine vision, revealing his Vishvarupa, a terrifying and infinite universal form.
Arjuna sees entire worlds created and destroyed in an instant. Overwhelmed, he realizes Krishna is beyond a mere
teacher or warrior. Krishna reassures him that those who surrender with pure devotion are always protected. In Chapter
12, he clarifies that knowledge and meditation are valuable, but the simplest and most direct path to liberation is
love and devotion.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-7">

<p>This section shifts from philosophy to an overwhelming display of divine power. Krishna’s universal form is beyond
human comprehension, showing that reality is both beautiful and destructive. It reminds me of other traditions where
encounters with the divine leave people in awe, like Moses seeing God or Buddhist teachings on impermanence. The three
gunas are fascinating because they explain why people act the way they do and how their inner qualities affect
spiritual growth. Krishna’s final message is clear. Knowledge and discipline are important, but pure devotion is even
greater.</p>

<p>The idea that devotion surpasses knowledge is unexpected but makes sense. At some point, reason and logic can only
take you so far. Krishna is saying that true peace comes from letting go and trusting something beyond yourself. The
universal form also puts things into perspective. Human concerns feel small compared to the vastness of reality. These
chapters reinforce the idea that surrendering to something bigger than yourself is not weakness, but the highest form
of wisdom.</p>

  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary-8">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Krishna explains the difference between the physical body and the true self. The body is temporary, shaped by the three
gunas, but the soul, or atman, is eternal and beyond material nature. He introduces prakriti, or the changing physical
world, and purusha, the unchanging self. Understanding this difference frees a person from illusion.</p>
<p>He expands on the gunas and how they shape human nature. Sattva is clarity and wisdom. Rajas is ambition and
restlessness. Tamas is ignorance and laziness. People are always influenced by these forces, but awareness allows them
to rise above.</p>
<p>In Chapter 15, Krishna describes the Tree of Life, an upside-down tree with roots in the heavens and branches in the
world. The branches represent attachment to material life, trapping people in illusion. Cutting through this tree with
wisdom leads to liberation. Chapter 16 draws a sharp contrast between divine and demonic qualities. Humility, truth,
and self-control lead to freedom, while arrogance, greed, and selfishness trap people in suffering. Krishna makes it
clear that no one is doomed, but people must choose their path.</p>
<p>Chapter 17 connects faith, food, and lifestyle to spiritual growth. Sattvic faith is selfless and pure. Rajasic faith
is based on personal gain. Tamasic faith is ignorant and harmful. The same applies to food, speech, and daily habits.
The final chapter ties everything together. Krishna explains Svadharma, the idea that everyone has a personal duty
based on their nature. True renunciation is not abandoning action but letting go of attachment to rewards. The Gita
ends with Krishna telling Arjuna to surrender completely and trust him. Arjuna, finally free from doubt, is ready to
fight.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-8">
  Thoughts
  <a class="anchor" href="#thoughts-8">#</a>
</h4>
<p>These last chapters drive home Krishna’s core message. The gunas explain why people struggle with their nature, but
they also show that growth is possible. The Tree of Life metaphor really stood out. It immediately reminded me of the
Celtic World Tree, which also connects the heavens, earth, and underworld. In both traditions, the tree represents the
cycle of life, but Krishna takes it a step further. He says that the material world is upside down, an illusion, and
that wisdom cuts through it. That idea aligns with other ancient traditions where the physical world is seen as a veil
over a deeper truth. The Norse Yggdrasil also comes to mind, where the tree holds everything together, but its branches
are constantly changing and affected by fate.</p>
<p>Krishna’s breakdown of divine and demonic traits in Chapter 16 was interesting because it is not about inherent good
or evil. People shape their destiny through their choices. The part about faith, food, and lifestyle in Chapter 17
also stood out. It is a reminder that spiritual growth is not just about big revelations. Small, everyday habits shape
who you become. The last chapter brings it all home. Krishna keeps saying that action itself isn’t the problem,
attachment is. That is the final lesson. Let go of control, do your duty, and move forward without fear.</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint warning">
<p><strong>Personal Takeaway</strong><br>
The Tree of Life metaphor hit the hardest. The idea of the material world as a tangled illusion feels familiar from
different traditions, but Krishna’s solution is simple. Instead of worshipping the tree or fearing it, cut through it
and see what is real. That applies to everything. People get stuck chasing success, comfort, and validation, but none
of it lasts. The challenge is learning to act without getting lost in the branches.</p>
<p>The gunas also made me think about how daily habits shape reality. It is not just about deep philosophy. The things
people do, the food they eat, and the way they think all reinforce a path. Recognizing that helps with self-awareness.
The ending of the Gita is a solid reminder that knowledge is useless if it does not lead to action. Arjuna spends the
entire book questioning, but in the end, he has to make a choice. That is the real takeaway. You can stay stuck in
doubt or you can trust, act, and move forward.</p>
