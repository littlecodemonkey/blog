This is a Sumerian poem about Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk and ruled around 2700 BCE. This story was spoken and told orally, but clay tablets have been found. The tablets date back to around 2100 BCE. They are written in a cuneiform script called Akkadian. This was the Semitic language  used in the Assyrian and Babylonian Around 1200 BCE, and the tablets were then compiled into their most complete form and into one single story by a Babylonian priest named Sin-Leqi-Unninni around 1200 BCE. These were multiple tales that were compiled into a larger story. Fragments were found all over Mesopotamia, so this story was widespread. The most complete version is called the &amp;ldquo;Standard Babylonian Version,&amp;rdquo; and it was discovered in Ashurbanipal&amp;rsquo;s library (an Assyrian king). This was discovered around the mid-19th century.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
