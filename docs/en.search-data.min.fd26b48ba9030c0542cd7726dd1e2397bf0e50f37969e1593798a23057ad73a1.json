It was written by a man named Vyasa. As I looked deeper into this work, I found that I needed the context of where this book came from.\nThis book appears to be a 700 verse excerpt from a larger work called the Mahabharata. This is truly an epic poem and is thousands of pages long. It reads very much like a relegious text to me.\nBasically, in the larger poem leading up to these events, it appears there was a king named Vichitravirya. He had multiple wives. He had some children, but one took a vow not to be the king. The writer of the epic, Vyasa, impregneates the queen after the king\u0026rsquo;s death in order to create an heir. This is apparently a traditional practice called Niyoga.\nThe oldest son was born blind, and there were two more sons. When the king died of a sickness, they didn\u0026rsquo;t want the blind son to be king, so Vidura (a wise sage) picked the younger son Pandu to be king. Pandu ends up retiring into the forest and the Blind son (Dhritarashtra) becomes king.\nAt one point the Pandavas are apparently killed, so the blind king picks a different successor. It turns out they weren\u0026rsquo;t really killed at all, and they come back asking for the kingdom. They end up playing a dice game for the kingdom and losing, and then are exiled for 13 years. When they come back from exile 13 years later, they fight a war to regain the kingdom.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very chaotic and there is a lot going on. Historically, it mostly seems plausable except for a lot of the talk of Gods and super powers in strength and such. It\u0026rsquo;s so politically chaotic and they all seem to have at least some claim to the throne that even Krishna himself (God in mortal form) can\u0026rsquo;t choose a side. Krishna offers his armies to one side and himself as a guide to the other side to be as fair as possible.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where the Gita picks up, at the battlefield of this great war. Krishna is hauling the chariot of a great archer and warrior, Arjuna.\nThoughts #  The Bhagavad Gita basically depicts a dialogue between Arjuna (this warrior) and Krishna (God in mortal form), while between two giant armies, immediately prior to the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and Kauravas.\nThe book seems best broken to me into three sections, chapters 1-6 (about the knowledge of self), chapters 7-12 (devotion to Krishna), and chapters 13-18 (relationship between atman and god, and the 3 qualities of creation).\nPart 1 (Chapters 1-6) #  This one is the easiest for me to break up. This one is pretty obvious and talks quite a bit on the self.\nChapter 1 #  Summary #  Krishna is hauling the chariot of Arjuna, and Arjuna feels like a badass and wants to be taken to the front lines to see the other side. There he sees relatives on both sides of the battle and it hits him hard. He knows that a lot of people are going to die, and he loses the will to fight. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to kill the people he loves and feels that life is worthless if he can\u0026rsquo;t spend it with his family. He thinks he\u0026rsquo;s better off being killed without a fight and lays down his bow and slumps into his chariot.\nThoughts #  After reading three different versions, the only part that caught me as difficult to comprehend was the family tradition talk. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I read a new translation by Flood and Martin that it made sense. They are talking about the caste system in India. Everyone in power is part of the highest caste and there is talk that the world will go into ruin if the blood is polluted. As a westerner, it caught me a little offguard. I figure that I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have more of these cultural concerns as I go down this journey, but I have to admit that it was surprising. Reading these books in the context of the history and cultures they were written in will force me to drop some biases and ethnocentrism.\nPersonal Takeaway\nOne thing that really resonated and was timely about this was the fact that Krishna waited until Arjuna was in a horrible place in his life, and right in the middle of the battle to show him wisdom and tell him about God. If he was all powerful, why did he wait until this moment? There had to have been a better time. It made me think, and perhaps even realize, that maybe the timing was right. Sometimes you need to be in the right state of mind to accept knowledge. Perhaps, I myself wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gotten this out of the text had I read it earlier in life, when I was younger and had less experiences, so maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a point to me going through this literary journey at this exact point in my life.
