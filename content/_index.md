# My Modern Renaissance Journey


## Woodworking
My son and I have a weekly woodworking channel on YouTube called [Friday Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw_6_OqDIcTAPEFeYzbuY_w).

We currently have well over 50 videos online and you can find some of the videos here.

## Understanding
I'm currently challenging myself with I call the **Brodsky Challenge**. I just made it up so I'm not even sure if it existed before this. I'm reading up on the 83 books Joseph Brodsky recommended a person read before they could have a basic conversation.

My assumption is that he meant an intelligent conversation, because this list is quite daunting. I'll be showing my progress on this site.

The list of books I have chosen for my **Brodsky Challenge** is located on my website [HERE](/blog/docs/reading)

## Billiards
I play billiards on a pool league whenever I can. My goal is to get better at the game and to learn more about the game of billiards. It's a slow learning process, but I'm getting better at it.

I have my own pool table, and I commonly play nine ball and eight ball billiards. I am currently ranked a 6 out of a possible 7 in the APA amateur pool league handicap system.

## Fencing
I have studied both modern Olympic style fencing and medeival rapier combat. My modern fencing instruction has mostly been within the Epee tradition. This is a style of Olympic fencing where a touch on any party of the body is considered vaild. It is what I have found to be most like rapier combat.

In rapier combat I have studied single sword combat, sword and shield, sword and buckler, sword and rotella, case (two swords), sword and cloak, sword and dagger, and dagger combat.

My focus has been mostly unpacking the works of Nicoletto Giganti in 1606 and 1622. I have also studied the works of Salvator Fabris, Achille Marozzo, Ridolfo Capo Ferro, Camilo Agrippa, Giacomo di Grassi, and George Silver. Mostly, my focus has been on the Baroque period of swordfighting. 

In late 2018, I tore my ACL in my knee in a fencing tournament and I have of late slowed down in the hobby. ACL reconstruction surgey with a cadaver ACL has proven a slow recovery process. I'm not certain that I'll ever get my knees back up to "fighting shape" unfortunatly.

### Teaching
Currently, above and beyond my full time job as a Lead Security Engineer, I am also moonlighting as an adjunct university professor for one class a semester at [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu) for the Cybersecurity Master's Degree Program.

I was able to create my own content for the courses I am teaching. I am quite proud of the classes, and I had a great time learning the univerisity's accredidation process. I look forward to creating even more university courses in the near future.

### Hacking CTFs
I also enjoy participating in computer hacking competitions, also called "Hacking Capture the Flag" competitions, or Hacking CTFs. This is one of the few legal ways to hone skills in hacking. The puzzles and mental challenges are very useful in keeping my mind busy and entertained. They are often very well done. If anyone is ever interesting in hacking CTFs, I usually send people to the [CTFtime Website](https://ctftime.org/). These CTFs commonly include challenges in:

- Reverse Engineering
- Binary Exploitation
- Web Exploitation
- Packet Analysis
- Cryptography
- Programming
- Stenography
- Forensics

## Future
In the future, I'm planning to dive even further into the depths of cybersecurity, and am considering possible PhD programs. I would like to look deeper into technical research. Also, I plan to research more into philosophy, writing, political thought, and sailing.
