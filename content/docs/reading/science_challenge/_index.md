# **List of Science Books**
Brodsky's list lacked a large amount of books on science. It was slanted toward history, philosophy, and literature. This was most likely due to the fact that Brodsky was a poet. I looked in depth for a quality science list, but I just couldn't find one. My options were to create one or crowd source one. I crowd sourced the list, and with the help of librarians and the good people on the Internet I was able to curate a few options to at least start from.
