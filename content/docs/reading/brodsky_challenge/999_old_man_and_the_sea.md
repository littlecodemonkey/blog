# The Old Man and the Sea  
By Ernest Hemingway  

## Overview

### Summary  
"The Old Man and the Sea" is one of Ernest Hemingway's most famous works. It was published in 1952, and this 
year for Christmas my buddy Wayne gifted my a first edition of the Novel. It's a fairly short books, and less than 200 pages. 
It tells the story of an old man in a Cuban fishing village. This is a story of struggle, and it starts with the fisherman 
going 84 days without catching a fish. 

### Thoughts  
Reading "The Old Man and the Sea" provides a deep reflection on the human spirit and its enduring quest for meaning. Santiago’s 
struggle with the marlin reminded me of the personal battles we all face, whether in careers, relationships, or life itself. 
There’s something profoundly human in the way Santiago perseveres, even in the face of overwhelming odds. It is also interesting 
to consider how Hemingway uses minimalism to create such depth, often leaving much unsaid. The idea that every victory can be 
hollow yet still worth pursuing resonates strongly.

### Takeaway
In a way, this feels like a story of meritocracy. Where the old man is successful because of his effort and perseverance. Despite his 
age and bad luck, his determination leads to his success in catching a big fish. It also is a story on how that meritocracy can be influced 
by external sources, especially related to the sharks. Merit and success are sometimes met with challenges beyond one's control, but as 
long as you remain diligent you will be successful in honor.

## The Story

### The Old Man and the Boy  
The old man befrinds a little boy, and the boy helps him fish for years. The boy, Manolin, is now forced to fish with another person because 
his parents believe the old man is unlucky in catching fish. The boy really cares for the old man, and there is a genuine feeling
of love between them.

There is a lot of talk about American baseball, and the old man is a fan of DiMaggio. The old man teaches the boy dignity and pride in this.

### The Struggle Begins  
On the 85th day without a fish, the old man goes out in his skiff. He catches an enormous marlin. The fish pulls on the boat for hours, and 
the old man cannot reel it in. The old man doesn't use a pole. He brings it in with a handline. The old man's hands get torn up and bleed. 
At points he believes he is going to lose fingers. The conflict is very real, and the unwavering resolve of the fisherman to handle the pain is admirable.

The old man talks of memories, and as he fights, he wishes the boy was there to help over and over again. His mental resolve is incredible.

### Victory and Loss  
After three days and nights of struggle, the old man finally catches the marlin. He ties it alongside his skiff and heads back in 
the way of Cuba. He has to guess which way the island is because he was drug so far off course. Sharks attack the marlin, and he 
loses a lot of it. Then, right before he pulls into the port, sharks come back and attack it again. There's basically nothing left 
but a skeleton. It's quite sad.

### Return and Reflection  
After the fight, the old man returns home and goes to sleep. He leaves the carcass tied to his boat. The boy visits him because he was 
worried the old man left three days ago. The whole village is talking about the enormous fish. Even though the old man is beaten up, 
he still has his pride as he felt he fought honorably.
