# Books in the Old Testament
These books span several religions are are interesting to read for sure. The Jewish, Islamic, and Christian faiths all 
have some ties to the Old Testament. This is possibly the most influential book in all of human history. Any journey of 
intellectualism would be incomplete without a review of this content.

## Books in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh)
The Jewish canon is organized differently from the Christian Old Testament. Also the Masoretic (Jewish) Text does have some 
wording, order, and emphasis differences from the Greek translation in the Christian bible (Septuagint). Honestly, it's 
broken up a little better and a little more understandable to read in the Greek (Christian) version.

The only major changes I saw were additions to Ester and Daniel in the Greek (Christian) version. 

The Greek (Christian) version includes six additional sections in Ester that elaborate on the religious themes, 
including prayers by Esther and Mordecai, and explicit mentions of God (which is not in the Hebrew version).

There are also three additional sections in the Greek versions of Daniel but not in the Hebrew Bible. The first is 
"The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children". This is inserted into Daniel 3. This addition 
includes a prayer by Azariah and a hymn of praise by the three men in the fiery furnace. The second addition I saw was 
"Susanna". This is a standalone story of Daniel's wisdom in saving a woman falsely accused of adultery. The last 
addition was "Bel and the Dragon". There are two stories in here that ridicule idolatry and emphasize Daniel's faith in 
God. There might be other changes, but I probably missed them as I'm not really a scholar of religions.

## Books in Islam
Islam does not directly adopt the Old Testament but acknowledges certain scriptures and stories within it, often 
through the lens of the Quran. Islam sees the Quran as the final and uncorrupted revelation, superseding the Torah, 
Psalms, and other previous scriptures. Stories and teachings from the Old Testament are often retold in the Quran with 
theological differences. As a result I don't really go through this too deeply. However, it important to recognise 
that this relationship exists.

- Recognized Scriptures
  - Tawrah (Torah): Given to Musa (Moses) and acknowledged as divine guidance.
  - Zabur (Psalms): Given to Dawud (David) as hymns of praise.
- Recognized Prophets and Figures (Shared with Old Testament)
  - Adam and Eve: The creation story and fall.
  - Nuh (Noah): The flood narrative.
  - Ibrahim (Abraham): The patriarch of monotheism.
  - Yusuf (Joseph): His trials in Egypt.
  - Musa (Moses): His role in leading the Israelites out of Egypt.
  - Dawud (David) and Sulaiman (Solomon): Kings and prophets.
  - Ayyub (Job): A model of patience.
  - Yunus (Jonah): His story with the whale.
