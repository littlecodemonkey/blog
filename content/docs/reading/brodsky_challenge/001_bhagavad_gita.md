# Bhagavad Gita
By Vyasa

## Overview
#### Summary
The Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual book from around 200 BC. It was written by a man named Vyasa. As I looked deeper into 
this work, I found that I needed the context of where this book came from.

This book appears to be a 700 verse excerpt from a larger work called the Mahabharata. This is truly an epic poem and 
is thousands of pages long. It reads very much like a relegious text to me.

Basically, in the larger poem leading up to these events, it appears there was a king named Vichitravirya. He had 
multiple wives. He had some children, but one took a vow not to be the king. The writer of the epic, Vyasa, 
impregneates the queen after the king's death in order to create an heir. This is apparently a traditional practice 
called Niyoga. 

The oldest son was born blind, and there were two more sons. When the king died of a sickness, they didn't want the 
blind son to be king, so Vidura (a wise sage) picked the younger son Pandu to be king. Pandu ends up retiring into the 
forest and the Blind son (Dhritarashtra) becomes king.

At one point the Pandavas are apparently killed, so the blind king picks a different successor. It turns out they 
weren't really killed at all, and they come back asking for the kingdom. They end up playing a dice game for the 
kingdom and losing, and then are exiled for 13 years. When they come back from exile 13 years later, they fight a war 
to regain the kingdom.

It's very chaotic and there is a lot going on. Historically, it mostly seems plausable except for a lot of the talk of 
Gods and super powers in strength and such. It's so politically chaotic and they all seem to have at least some claim 
to the throne that even Krishna himself (God in mortal form) can't choose a side. Krishna offers his armies to one side 
and himself as a guide to the other side to be as fair as possible.

That's where the Gita picks up, at the battlefield of this great war. Krishna is hauling the chariot of a great archer 
and warrior, Arjuna.

#### Thoughts
The Bhagavad Gita basically depicts a dialogue between Arjuna (this warrior) and Krishna (God in mortal form), while 
between two giant armies, immediately prior to the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and Kauravas.

The book seems best broken to me into three sections, chapters 1-6 (about the knowledge of self), chapters 7-12 
(devotion to Krishna), and chapters 13-18 (relationship between atman and god, and the 3 qualities of creation).

## Part 1 (Chapters 1-6)
This one is the easiest for me to break up. This one is pretty obvious and talks quite a bit on the self.

## Book Summary
### Chapter 1
#### Summary
Krishna is hauling the chariot of Arjuna, and Arjuna feels like a badass and wants to be taken to the front lines to 
see the other side. There he sees relatives on both sides of the battle and it hits him hard. He knows that a lot of 
people are going to die, and he loses the will to fight. He doesn't want to kill the people he loves and feels that 
life is worthless if he can't spend it with his family. He thinks he's better off being killed without a fight and lays 
down his bow and slumps into his chariot.

#### Thoughts
After reading three different versions, the only part that caught me as difficult to comprehend was the family 
tradition talk. It wasn't until I read a new translation by Flood and Martin that it made sense. They are talking 
about the caste system in India. Everyone in power is part of the highest caste and there is talk that the world will 
go into ruin if the blood is polluted. As a westerner, it caught me a little offguard. I figure that I'll probably have 
more of these cultural concerns as I go down this journey, but I have to admit that it was surprising. Reading these 
books in the context of the history and cultures they were written in will force me to drop some biases and 
ethnocentrism.

#### Personal Takeaway  
One thing that really resonated and was timely about this was the fact that Krishna waited until Arjuna was in a 
horrible place in his life, and right in the middle of the battle to show him wisdom and tell him about God. If he was 
all powerful, why did he wait until this moment? There had to have been a better time. It made me think, and perhaps 
even realize, that maybe the timing was right. Sometimes you need to be in the right state of mind to accept knowledge. 
Perhaps, I myself wouldn't have gotten this out of the text had I read it earlier in life, when I was younger and had 
less experiences, so maybe there's a point to me going through this literary journey at this exact point in my life.

### Chapter 2
#### Summary
This is about the practice of "yoga". This continues the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna. Arjuna is still 
hesitant to go to war. Krishna first tells him that he needs to be more of a man or he won't go to heaven. Arjuna, 
decides to not fight and Krishna changes tactics to take a more intellectual approach and explain more to Arjuna in 
detail.

The Soul - 
This talks a little about reincarnation at the beginning. About how our soul finds new bodies after death, and that 
while the body is affected by "weapons, fire, water, and air" the soul is not. It is never born and doesn't die. It is 
forever and unchanging. There is some contradiction later where Krishna says even if the soul is born and dies you 
shouldn't morn it because all things eventually end.

The Dharma - 
Dharma appears to be a relegious or moral duty from the text. It's listed as the responsibilities of a warrior 
(Kshritya). Krishna basically tells Arjuna to "man up" and be stronger. A lot of this is about honor and that disgrace 
is a fear worse than death. There is a logic that, if he fights for this Dharma and dies he will go to heaven, and if 
he wins and lives then he will also win and gain great wealth.

The Kharma - 
Krishna tells Arjuna to not think about fighting and just fight. If he acts without thinking of the reprecussions he 
can act without fear and his brain won't go haywire. Krishna then goes on to say that he should not worry about what he
will gain from the action, that when action is performed for simply the action's sake without the thought of success or 
failure, it is called Yoga. He mentions that Yoga is liberating to the mind and body. Once you learn how to act without 
thinking then he won't need to learn anything from scriptures. 

The Senses - 
When the mind is untroubled, unattached from all things, and the person just acts, then that's a person of firm wisdom. 
He should avoid all senses and not dwell on senses because then he will desire things, desiring things leads to 
attachment of things, and attachment of things leads to anger, anger can lead to confusion and then weakness.

The goal here seems to be serenity. He basically is trying to get Arjuna to calm down and gain control over his senses 
and emotions so that he can clear his mind.

#### Thoughts
This seems very similar to some of the stuff the stocis say, and I'm really interested to follow up with the works of 
Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurillus later and compare notes to this. I can also see a lot of where modern yoga came 
out of this book. There's a lot in modern yoga about clearing the mind and avoiding attachments. The stuff on 
centering yourself and clearing your thoughts is facinating. You can really see how Krishna would be trying to convince 
him that everything was ok, and he could go ahead and fight.

#### Personal Takeaway  
Chapter 2 seems to be the most powerful in the whole book. There are some real interesting topics about the individual 
and how a person should act and think. It's incredible how more of these are applicable thousands of years later.

### Chapter 3
#### Summary
Chapter three is the Yoga of Action. Arjun ask at the beginning to Krishna, if you consider knowledge superior to action
then why do you ask me to wage this terrible war? At this point Arjun is still trying to get out of fighting the war.

Krishna explains there are two paths to Yoga.  Te path of knowledge, for those inclined toward contemplation, and the 
path of work for those inclined toward action. He mentions that one cannot obtain freedom from karmic reactions from 
merely not acting, nor can one attain perfect knowledge by mere physical renunciation. Basically what he is saying here
is that action is something you can't avoid. Even maintain the body requires action of some sort.

There's a concept here called Nishkama Karma introduced as well. Basically this is performing actions without an 
attachment to the results. It promotes selfless action. There is a mention that if you're a good person just to get 
into heaven, then you probably won't get into heaven. You have to be a good person without any expectations. You are
entitled to your work, but don't feel entitled to the fruits of your labor. You should see the work you do as a 
service to society. Chapter 3, Verse 19 sums this up... "Therefore, without attachment, do your duty, because by 
working without attachment, one attains the Supreme."

The main obstacles to spiritual progress are listed as desire (Kama) and anger (Krodha). Krishna advises to master 
these through self-discipline and self awareness.


#### Thoughts
There's a lot to unpack here. The main thing is that you shouldn't do things for the outcome of those things. You
should be doing things because you feel this is the best way to live. 

This reminds me of the book "No More Mr. Nice Guy" by Dr. Robert Glover. I read this book right after my divorce and 
it was very inciteful. He states that "nicy guys" often act out of covert contracts. An idea of "if I do this, someone
else with do this". They expect approval, validation, or some form of reciprocation in return. There's a thought here 
to take responsibility for ones one actions and live authentically, rather than seeking external validation. This very 
much aligns with the advice in the Gita to act without an attachment to the results. Instead the person should be 
focusing on doing what's right.

{{% hint warning %}}
#### Personal Takeaway
Krishna also talks about performing one's individual duty (Swa-Dharma) rather than trying to mimic others. No More Mr.
Nice Guy mentions that "nice guys" often neglect their own needs to fit into other's expectations of them, or societal 
molds. The book talks about finding and following your own true purpose instead of seeking approval or avoiding 
conflict. I'm not certain if Dr. Glover read the Gita, but there are many parallels between his book and this chapter 
of the Gita.

### Chapter 4
#### Summary
Krishna shifts from talking about action to knowledge, revealing that the wisdom he’s sharing is ancient but was lost 
over time. Then he drops the big reveal; he’s God in human form, here to restore Dharma. He tells Arjuna that whenever 
righteousness declines, he manifests to set things right, protect the good, and destroy evil. This introduces Jnana 
Karma Sanyasa, the idea that true renunciation isn’t about avoiding action but acting with knowledge and detachment. 
He expands on sacrifice (yajna) beyond traditional rituals, explaining that real sacrifice includes giving up ego, 
desires, and even attachment to knowledge itself. The key takeaway: if Arjuna surrenders to divine wisdom, he’ll be 
free from past karma and can move forward without fear.

#### Thoughts
Krishna takes things up a notch here, shifting from philosophy to straight-up divine authority. He’s not just giving 
advice anymore. He’s saying, I’m God, trust me. The idea that God shows up to restore balance when things go off the 
rails has a mythological feel, reminding me of similar themes in other religions. The part about sacrificing knowledge 
is unexpected. Krishna has been preaching wisdom, and now he’s saying not to cling to it too tightly. That tracks with 
the Zen “beginner’s mind” idea. True wisdom comes from letting go of rigid thinking. Also, the surrender to divine will 
here feels like an early version of Bhakti (devotion), similar to Christian ideas of grace. Trusting in something higher 
wipes away past mistakes.

{{% hint warning %}}
#### Personal Takeaway  
This chapter refines the previous message: act with knowledge, but don’t get attached to outcomes. The deeper idea on 
sacrifice also hit me. People give up time, money, and energy all the time, but Krishna is talking about giving up ego 
and the need for control. That’s real freedom. Also, his message about past mistakes is powerful. You’re not bound by 
who you used to be, you can start fresh. This makes me want to explore more on Bhakti philosophy and also compare it 
to Stoicism, especially Epictetus, who emphasizes controlling what’s in your power and surrendering the rest.

### Chapter 5
#### Summary
Arjuna is still unsure whether renouncing action or acting without attachment is the better path. Krishna tells him 
that both lead to the same goal, but acting without attachment is superior because it is more practical. True 
renunciation isn’t about avoiding responsibilities but about performing one’s duty without selfish motives. A person 
who works while surrendering the results is truly free. Krishna explains that a wise person sees no real difference 
between success and failure, pleasure and pain, or even friend and enemy. Those who master this mindset attain inner 
peace and unity with the divine.

#### Thoughts
This chapter makes it clear that renunciation is not about inaction but about mindset. Krishna shows that enlightenment 
isn’t found by withdrawing from the world but by fully engaging in it without attachment. That reminds me of Stoicism, 
especially Marcus Aurelius, who emphasizes doing one’s duty without concern for rewards or recognition. The idea that a 
wise person treats all experiences equally is tough to grasp but makes sense if the goal is inner peace. If you are not 
constantly chasing pleasure or avoiding discomfort, you remain steady no matter what happens.


{{% hint warning %}}
#### Personal Takeaway  
The biggest lesson here is that peace comes from letting go of control, not from avoiding responsibility. This applies 
to everything whether work, relationships, or personal goals. Focusing on effort rather than results keeps you from 
getting caught up in disappointment and frustration. This connects to modern ideas about mindfulness and flow, where 
success comes from being fully present in the process. Krishna keeps repeating this message, and I see why. It is 
simple but one of the hardest things to actually live by.

### Chapter 6
#### Summary
Krishna shifts focus to meditation as the key to self-mastery. He explains that the true yogi is not someone who simply 
renounces the world but someone who balances action and detachment. A real yogi neither avoids responsibility nor 
becomes obsessed with results. Instead, they stay steady in all situations, free from attachment and ego. He describes 
meditation as the ultimate path to self-realization, where the mind is disciplined and focused only on the divine. The 
best meditator is one who sees all beings as equal and recognizes the presence of the divine in everyone. Krishna ends 
by declaring that of all yogis, those who surrender to him with devotion are the highest.

#### Thoughts
This chapter brings everything together. Krishna has been telling Arjuna to act without attachment, but now he’s 
explaining how to do it through meditation. The way he describes it makes it clear that meditation isn’t just about 
sitting in silence but about training the mind to stay calm and focused. This connects to a lot of modern mindfulness 
and Stoic ideas. Marcus Aurelius talks about keeping the mind steady no matter what happens, which is exactly what 
Krishna is saying. The idea that the best yogi sees everyone as equal also stands out. It reinforces that detachment 
doesn’t mean indifference. It means seeing things clearly and acting with compassion instead of impulse.

{{% hint warning %}}
#### Personal Takeaway  
Krishna’s message about balance really resonates. It’s not about extreme renunciation or blind ambition but about 
being steady no matter what life throws at you. Meditation isn’t just about closing your eyes and breathing; it’s 
about building the mental strength to stay centered in the middle of chaos. That applies to everything. work, 
relationships, even personal struggles. Krishna keeps pushing the idea that the highest path isn’t just knowledge or 
action but a combination of both, grounded in discipline and focus. It’s easy to see why meditation has become such a 
central part of so many spiritual traditions.

## Part 2 (Chapter 7-12)
### Chapter 7-12
#### Summary
Krishna moves from self-discipline and meditation to bhakti, or devotion. He explains that everything in existence, 
both material and spiritual, comes from him. Some people seek him for selfish reasons, while others seek him with 
wisdom and love. He introduces the three gunas-sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance). These shape 
human behavior. Those who transcend these qualities through devotion achieve liberation.

Krishna describes himself as the ultimate reality behind all things. He is time, creation, destruction, and the source 
of all wisdom. In Chapter 10, he lists the ways he manifests in the world, from the Himalayas to the power of speech. 
In Chapter 11, he grants Arjuna divine vision, revealing his Vishvarupa, a terrifying and infinite universal form. 
Arjuna sees entire worlds created and destroyed in an instant. Overwhelmed, he realizes Krishna is beyond a mere 
teacher or warrior. Krishna reassures him that those who surrender with pure devotion are always protected. In Chapter 
12, he clarifies that knowledge and meditation are valuable, but the simplest and most direct path to liberation is 
love and devotion.

#### Thoughts
This section shifts from philosophy to an overwhelming display of divine power. Krishna’s universal form is beyond 
human comprehension, showing that reality is both beautiful and destructive. It reminds me of other traditions where 
encounters with the divine leave people in awe, like Moses seeing God or Buddhist teachings on impermanence. The three 
gunas are fascinating because they explain why people act the way they do and how their inner qualities affect 
spiritual growth. Krishna’s final message is clear. Knowledge and discipline are important, but pure devotion is even 
greater.


{{% hint warning %}}
#### Personal Takeaway  
The idea that devotion surpasses knowledge is unexpected but makes sense. At some point, reason and logic can only 
take you so far. Krishna is saying that true peace comes from letting go and trusting something beyond yourself. The 
universal form also puts things into perspective. Human concerns feel small compared to the vastness of reality. This 
chapter reinforces the idea that surrendering to something bigger than yourself is not weakness, but the highest form 
of wisdom.
