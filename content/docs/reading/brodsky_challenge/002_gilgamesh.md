# Gilgamesh
By Sin-Leqi-Unninni

## Overview
### Summary
This is one of the oldest stories ever known. This is a Sumerian poem about Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk and ruled around 2700 BCE. This story was spoken and told orally, but clay tablets have been found. The tablets date back to around 2100 BCE. They are written in a cuneiform script called Akkadian. This was the Semitic language  used in the Assyrian and Babylonian Around 1200 BCE, and the tablets were then compiled into their most complete form and into one single story by a Babylonian priest named Sin-Leqi-Unninni around 1200 BCE. These were multiple tales that were compiled into a larger story. Fragments were found all over Mesopotamia, so this story was widespread. The most complete version is called the "Standard Babylonian Version," and it was discovered in Ashurbanipal's library (an Assyrian king). This was discovered around the mid-19th century.

There are twelve tablets. This is very significant as its stories parallel later works. A major one is the Bible's story of the flood in Genesis. The story also mirrors the Greek myth where Deucalion and his wife survive a great flood sent by Zeus and repopulate the Earth, although the story of Noah is much closer to Gilgamesh. A flood story predates Gilgamesh, and that's the Mesopotamian Epic myth of Atrahasis. A god tells Atrahasis to build a boat to survive a flood meant to wipe out humanity.

**Personal Takeaway**  
I had always understood that wedding rings were first associated with the Romans or with the "rings of love" from the Egyptians, who are sometimes credited with exchanging rings as symbols of love. However, while reading the Epic of Gilgamesh, I came across a passage in Tablet VIII that states, "of the wife place a ring on you, mourn you." This could be referring to wedding rings, or I could be misunderstanding this.{{< /hint >}}



## Book Summary
### Tablet I: Introduction and Gilgamesh's Rule
Gilgamesh is described as a demi-god. He's two-thirds god and one-third human. He is strong and massive in size. However, he's very oppressive. One of the rights of the king is called "first rights". First rights are royal privileges, and the right a king has to be the first of anything. The first to resources, the first to food, and the first to fruits of labor. Gilgamesh abused this by claiming the virginity of women on their wedding night. The people of Uruk feel he abused his first rights, but this one is the one they resented the most.

In response to the people's complaints, the gods created a wild man to confront him. This wild man is named Enkidu. Enkidu ends up being tricked into joining the human world by having sex with a human. The local farmer/hunter hired a prostitute to have sex with Enkidu so that he wouldn't be a wild animal anymore.

### Tablet II: Enkidu's Civilizing and Meeting with Gilgamesh
Enkidu is a huge man. The temple prostitute (Shamat) seduces Enkidu and brings Enkidu to challenge Gilgamesh. Enkidu stands at the doorway to a chapel to prevent Gilgamesh from claiming first rights to a bride, and they get into a fistfight. Gilgamesh barely wins. However, he grows as a person from the fight and the two become best friends out of mutual respect.
