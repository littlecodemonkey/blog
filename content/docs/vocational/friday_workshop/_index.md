## Vocational
My son and I have a weekly woodworking channel on YouTube called **[Friday Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw_6_OqDIcTAPEFeYzbuY_w)**. We currently have well over 50 videos online and you can find some of the videos [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw_6_OqDIcTAPEFeYzbuY_w).

### Friday Workshop Overview
I chose the medium of woodworking originally to bond with my son over a jointly acquired skill. This has been wonderful, and the time that we have spent together has been amazing. This was also originally started to get him over the bordom of coronavirus lockdowns. After the lockdowns have subsided, we still continue to learn woodworking. 

### Surprise Knowledge
We have found a passion for the hobby and really enjoy spending the time together. Not only have we gained the woodworking skills, but also the surprising bonus skills:

- graphic artwork
- video editing
- audio editing
- marketing
- and other production skills that are required to keep a weekly channel on YouTube going. 

### Future Plans
We plan to branch out from woodworking into other makerspaces eventually and the plan is to get Friday Workshop involved in the following vocational skills.

- Woodworking
- Welding
- Electronics
- 3d printing
- Machining
